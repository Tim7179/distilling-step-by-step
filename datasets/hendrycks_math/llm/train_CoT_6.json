Now we can solve for $x$ with $x+(x+30)=90$, which yields $x=30$. The degree measure of $\\angle LOQ$ is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 2}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$. Since $\\overline{NO}$ and $\\overline{ML}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal. The interior angles of a trapezoid sum to $360^\\circ$, so we have $2z+120+120=360$, which yields $z=60$. Angle $O$ is an interior angle of a hexagon that measure $120^\\circ$, so $z+x+30=120$.

  "We can draw two similar hexagons, an outer one for which the large circle is the circumcircle and an inner one that connects the centers of the smaller circles. We know that the sidelength of the inner hexagon is 6 since $\\overline{DE}$ consists of the radii of two small circles. We also know that the radius of the outer hexagon is 3 units longer than the radius of the inner hexagon since $\\overline{AD}$ is the radius of a small circle. There are now several approaches to solving the problem.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 1:}$ We use a 30-60-90 triangle to find the radius $\\overline{CD}$ of the inner hexagon. Triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle since $\\overline{CE}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are both radii of a regular hexagon. So dropping a perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overline{DE}$ bisects $\\angle C$ and $\\overline{DE}$ and creates two congruent right triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{6}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. Each right triangle has a leg of length $\\frac{DE}{2}=3$ and is a 30-60-90 right triangle (since $\\angle C$ was bisected into two angles of $30^\\circ$). That makes the length of the hypotenuse (the radius of the inner hexagon) two times the length of the short leg, or $2\\cdot3=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 2:}$ We prove that the triangles formed by the center to two vertices of a regular hexagon (such as $\\triangle CED$ and $\\triangle CBA$) are equilateral triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. The interior angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{180^\\circ (6-2)}{6}=\\frac{180^\\circ \\cdot4}{6}=30^\\circ \\cdot4=120^\\circ$. That means the other two angles in the triangle each have a measure of half the interior angle, or $60^\\circ$. All three angles equal $60^\\circ$ so the triangle is an equilateral triangle. Then we know that $CD=DE=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 3:}$ Another way to prove that the triangles are equilateral is to show that triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle and $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$ (see other approaches for how). That means $m\\angle D=m\\angle E$ and $m\\angle D+ m\\angle E=120^\\circ$. Then all three angles have a measure of $60^\\circ$ each.

  "The two circles described in the problem are shown in the diagram.  The circle located inside $\\triangle ABC$ is called the incircle; following convention we will label its center $I$.  The other circle is known as an excircle, and we label its center $E$.  To begin, we may compute the area of triangle $ABC$ using Heron's formula.  The side lengths of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ are $a=15$, $b=14$, and $c=13$, while the semiperimeter is $s=\\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)=21$, so its area is \\[ K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{21\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8} = 84. \\]We find the inradius $r$ of $\\triangle ABC$ by using the fact that $K=rs$, so $84=21r$, giving $r=4$.  Next label the points of tangency of the incircle and excircle with ray $\\overline{AC}$ as $S$ and $T$, as shown at right.  It is a standard fact that $AS=s-a=6$ and $AT=s=21$. (The reader should confirm this.  Repeatedly use the fact that tangents from a point to a circle have the same length.)

  "Since the smaller triangle has hypotenuse 5, we guess that it is a 3-4-5 triangle.  Sure enough, the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 is $(3)(4)/2 = 6$, so this works.

Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is $5(3+4) = \\boxed{35}$.\n\nProof that the only possibility for the smaller triangle is that it is a 3-4-5 triangle: Let's call the legs of the smaller triangle $a$ and $b$ (with $b$ being the longer leg) and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle $c$. Similarly, let's call the corresponding legs of the larger triangle $A$ and $B$ and the hypotenuse of the larger triangle $C$. Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we can say  $$\\frac{1}{2}ab=6.$$ Additionally, we are told that the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches, so $c=5$ and $$a^2+b^2=25.$$ Because $\\frac{1}{2}ab=6$, we get $ab=12$ or $a=\\frac{12}{b}$.

  "Firstly, we note the statement in the problem that \"$AD$ is the only chord starting at $A$ and bisected by $BC$\" – what is its significance? What is the criterion for this statement to be true?\nWe consider the locus of midpoints of the chords from $A$. It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter $AO$, where $O$ is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and center $A$. Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and centre $A$ of circle $O$. Let the center of this circle be $P$.\nNow, $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle. Moreover, since $AD$ is the only chord, $BC$ must be tangent to the circle $P$.\nThe rest of this problem is straightforward.\nOur goal is to find $\\sin \\angle AOB = \\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)}$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. We have $BM=3$ and $OM=4$. Let $R$ be the projection of $A$ onto $OM$, and similarly let $Q$ be the projection of $P$ onto $OM$. Then it remains to find $AR$ so that we can use the addition formula for $\\sin$.\nAs $PN$ is a radius of circle $P$, $PN=2.5$, and similarly, $PO=2.5$. Since $OM=4$, we have $OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5$. Thus $PQ=\\sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2$.\nFurther, we see that $\\triangle OAR$ is a dilation of $\\triangle OPQ$ about center $O$ with scale factor $2$, so $AR=2PQ=4$.\nLastly, we apply the formula:\\[\\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)} = \\sin \\angle AOM \\cos \\angle BOM - \\sin \\angle BOM \\cos \\angle AOM = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)=\\frac{7}{25}\\]Thus the answer is $7\\cdot25=\\boxed{175}$.

A line passing through $(3,0)$ is such that the total area of the parts of the three circles to one side of the line is equal to the total area of the parts of the three circles to the other side of it. What is the absolute value of the slope of this line?\nNote that this is equivalent to finding a line such that the distance from $(0,16)$ to the line is the same as the distance from $(5,8)$ to the line. Let the line be $y - ax - b = 0$. Then, we have that:\\[\\frac{|-5a + 8 - b|}{\\sqrt{a^2+1}}= \\frac{|16 - b|}{\\sqrt{a^2+1}} \\Longleftrightarrow |-5a+8-b| = |16-b|\\]We can split this into two cases.\nCase 1: $16-b = -5a + 8 - b \\Longleftrightarrow a = -\\frac{8}{5}$\nIn this case, the absolute value of the slope of the line won’t be an integer, and since this is an AIME problem, we know it’s not possible.\nCase 2: $b-16 = -5a + 8 - b \\Longleftrightarrow 2b + 5a = 24$\nBut we also know that it passes through the point $(3,0)$, so $-3a-b = 0 \\Longleftrightarrow b = -3a$.

Quickly we realize that $O$ is also the center of the rectangle.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, we can solve for a side of the rhombus; $PQ = \\sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = 25$. Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, we have that $OP = 15, OQ = 20$. Also, $\\angle POQ = 90^{\\circ}$, so quadrilateral $BPOQ$ is cyclic. By Ptolemy's Theorem, $25 \\cdot OB = 20 \\cdot 15 + 15 \\cdot 20 = 600$.\nBy similar logic, we have $APOS$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let $AP = x$, $AS = y$.

Since the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, $OA = \\frac{1}{2}d = OB$, and $20x + 15y = 600\\quad \\mathrm{(2)}$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 40 - \\frac 43x$.

Let $A$ be at the origin, $B$ at $(20,0,0)$, $C$ at $(20,0,20)$, and $D$ at $(20,20,20)$. Thus, $P$ is at $(5,0,0)$, $Q$ is at $(20,0,15)$, and $R$ is at $(20,10,20)$.\nLet the plane $PQR$ have the equation $ax + by + cz = d$. Using point $P$, we get that $5a = d$. Using point $Q$, we get $20a + 15c = d \\Longrightarrow 4d + 15c = d \\Longrightarrow d = -5c$. Using point $R$, we get $20a + 10b + 20c = d \\Longrightarrow 4d + 10b - 4d = d \\Longrightarrow d = 10b$.

After doing a little bit of algebra, the intersections are the lines $y = -2x + 10$, $y = -2x + 50$, $y = 2z + 10$, and $z = x + 5$. Thus, there are three more vertices on the polygon, which are at $(0,10,0)(0,20,5)(15,20,20)$.\nWe can find the lengths of the sides of the polygons now. There are 4 right triangles with legs of length 5 and 10, so their hypotenuses are $5\\sqrt{5}$. The other two are of $45-45-90 \\triangle$s with legs of length 15, so their hypotenuses are $15\\sqrt{2}$.

Observe that\\[OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2;\\]the first equality follows by the Pythagorean Theorem, while the second follows from $AF = FP$ and $AE = EP$.

The equation of $BE$ is simply $x=16$. $AD$ is perpendicular to line $BC$, so the slope of $AD$ is equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of $BC$. $BC$ has slope $\\frac{24-0}{16-34}=-\\frac{4}{3}$, therefore $y=\\frac{3}{4} x$.

  "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$.

  "Let $O$ be center of the circle and $P$,$Q$ be the two points of tangent such that $P$ is on $BI$ and $Q$ is on $AI$. We know that $AD:CD = CD:BD = 12:35$.\nSince the ratios between corresponding lengths of two similar diagrams are equal, we can let $AD = 144, CD = 420$ and $BD = 1225$. Hence $AQ = 144, BP = 1225, AB = 1369$ and the radius $r = OD = 210$.\nSince we have $\\tan OAB = \\frac {35}{24}$ and $\\tan OBA = \\frac{6}{35}$ , we have $\\sin {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {1369}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}},$$\\cos {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {630}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}}$.\nHence $\\sin I = \\sin {(2OAB + 2OBA)} = \\frac {2*1369*630}{1801*1261}$. let $IP = IQ = x$ , then we have Area$(IBC)$ = $(2x + 1225*2 + 144*2)*\\frac {210}{2}$ = $(x + 144)(x + 1225)* \\sin {\\frac {I}{2}}$. Then we get $x + 1369 = \\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261}$.\nNow the equation looks very complex but we can take a guess here. Assume that $x$ is a rational number (If it's not then the answer to the problem would be irrational which can't be in the form of $\\frac {m}{n}$) that can be expressed as $\\frac {a}{b}$ such that $(a,b) = 1$. Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.\nLet's see if $x = \\frac {1369}{3}$ fits. Since $\\frac {1369}{3} + 1369 = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$, and $\\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261} = \\frac {3*1369* \\frac {1801}{3} * \\frac {1261*4}{3}} {1801*1261} = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$. Amazingly it fits!\nSince we know that $3*1369*144*1225 - 1369*1801*1261 < 0$, the other solution of this equation is negative which can be ignored. Hence $x = 1369/3$.\nHence the perimeter is $1225*2 + 144*2 + \\frac {1369}{3} *2 = 1369* \\frac {8}{3}$, and $BC$ is $1369$. Hence $\\frac {m}{n} = \\frac {8}{3}$, $m + n = \\boxed{11}$.

Ah, but $\\angle AFE = \\angle ACE$ (since $F$ lies on $\\omega$), and we can find $cos \\angle ACE$ using the law of cosines:\n$AE^2 = AC^2 + CE^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot CE \\cdot \\cos \\angle ACE$, and plugging in $AE = 8, AC = 3, BE = BC = 7,$ we get $\\cos \\angle ACE = -1/7 = \\cos \\angle AFE$.\nAlso, $\\angle AEF = \\angle DEF$, and $\\angle DFE = \\pi/2$ (since $F$ is on the circle $\\gamma$ with diameter $DE$), so $\\cos \\angle AEF = EF/DE = 8 \\cdot EF/49$.\nPlugging in all our values into equation (2), we get:\n$EF = -\\frac{AF}{7} + 8 \\cdot \\frac{8EF}{49}$, or $EF = \\frac{7}{15} \\cdot AF$.\nFinally, we plug this into equation (1), yielding:\n$8^2 = AF^2 + \\frac{49}{225} \\cdot AF^2 - 2 \\cdot AF \\cdot \\frac{7AF}{15} \\cdot \\frac{-1}{7}$. Thus,\n$64 = \\frac{AF^2}{225} \\cdot (225+49+30),$ or $AF^2 = \\frac{900}{19}.$ The answer is $\\boxed{919}$. The answer is 919.",

  "Let $P$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $\\overline{CR}$, so $\\overline{AP}\\parallel\\overline{EM}$.

  "Let the tangent circle be $\\omega$. Some notation first: let $BC=a$, $AB=b$, $s$ be the semiperimeter, $\\theta=\\angle ABC$, and $r$ be the inradius. Intuition tells us that the radius of $\\omega$ is $r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}$ (using the exradius formula). However, the sum of the radius of $\\omega$ and $\\frac{rs}{s-b}$ is equivalent to the distance between the incenter and the the $B/C$ excenter. Denote the B excenter as $I_B$ and the incenter as $I$. Lemma: $I_BI=\\frac{2b*IB}{a}$ We draw the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$. Let the angle bisector of $\\angle ABC$ hit the circumcircle at a second point $M$. By the incenter-excenter lemma, $AM=CM=IM$. Let this distance be $\\alpha$. Ptolemy's theorem on $ABCM$ gives us\\[a\\alpha+b\\alpha=b(\\alpha+IB)\\to \\alpha=\\frac{b*IB}{a}\\]Again, by the incenter-excenter lemma, $II_B=2IM$ so $II_b=\\frac{2b*IB}{a}$ as desired. Using this gives us the following equation:\\[\\frac{2b*IB}{a}=r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\\frac{rs}{s-b}\\]Motivated by the $s-a$ and $s-b$, we make the following substitution: $x=s-a, y=s-b$ This changes things quite a bit. Here's what we can get from it:\\[a=2y, b=x+y, s=x+2y\\]It is known (easily proved with Heron's and a=rs) that\\[r=\\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-b)}{s}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}}\\]Using this, we can also find $IB$: let the midpoint of $BC$ be $N$. Using Pythagorean's Theorem on $\\triangle INB$,\\[IB^2=r^2+(\\frac{a}{2})^2=\\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}+y^2=\\frac{2xy^2+2y^3}{x+2y}=\\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}\\]We now look at the RHS of the main equation:\\[r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\\frac{rs}{s-b}=r(1+\\frac{2(x+2y)}{x}+\\frac{x+2y}{y})=r(\\frac{x^2+5xy+4y^2}{xy})=\\frac{r(x+4y)(x+y)}{xy}=\\frac{2(x+y)IB}{2y}\\]Cancelling some terms, we have\\[\\frac{r(x+4y)}{x}=IB\\]Squaring,\\[\\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}=\\frac{(x+4y)^2*xy^2}{x^2(x+2y)}\\to \\frac{(x+4y)^2}{x}=2(x+y)\\]Expanding and moving terms around gives\\[(x-8y)(x+2y)=0\\to x=8y\\]Reverse substituting,\\[s-a=8s-8b\\to b=\\frac{9}{2}a\\]Clearly the smallest solution is $a=2$ and $b=9$, so our answer is $2+9+9=\\boxed{20}$.

Let the point of intersection be $K$. We note that $EBK$ is also a right isosceles triangle with side $2-\\sqrt{2}$ and find it's area to be $3-2\\sqrt{2}$. Now, we notice that $FIK$ is also a right isosceles triangle and find it's area to be $\\frac{1}{2}$$FI^2$. This is also equal to $1+3-2\\sqrt{2}$ or $4-2\\sqrt{2}$. Since we are looking for $FI^2$, we want two times this. That gives $\\boxed{8-4\\sqrt{2}}$. The answer is 8-4\\sqrt{2}."
