  "The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{1st red}) \\times P(\\text{2nd red \\textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\\frac{3}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{4}{10}\\times \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = P(\\text{1st blue}) \\times P(\\text{2nd blue \\textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\\frac{6}{10}$.  After drawing a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also blue is $\\frac{5}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = \\frac{6}{10}\\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}. $$Since drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles are exclusive events, we add the individual probabilities to get the probability of one or the other occurring.

  "If $\\sqrt{a+\\sqrt{b}}$ is an integer, then its square $a+\\sqrt{b}$ is also an integer.  Therefore, $\\sqrt{b}$ is an integer.  In other words, $b$ must be a perfect square.  If we define $c=\\sqrt{b}$, then the problem has asked us to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,c)$ for which $1\\leq a \\leq 10$, $1\\leq c\\leq 6$, and $a+c$ is a perfect square.  We check the 6 possibilities for $c$ separately.  If $c=1$, then $a$ is 3 or 8.  If $c=2$, then $a$ is 2 or 7.  If $c=3$, then $a$ is 1 or 6.  If $c=4$, then $a=5$, and if $c=5$, then $a=4$.  Finally, if $c=6$, then $a$ is either 10 or 3.  Altogether, there are $2+2+2+1+1+2=\\boxed{10}$ ordered pairs $(a,c)$ satisfying the given conditions. The answer is 10.",

  "The arithmetic mean equals the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements in the row. In Pascal's Triangle where the first row is $n=0$, row $n$ has $n+1$ elements and the sum of the elements is $2^n$, which makes the arithmetic mean $\\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. Now we look for the value of $n$ that satisfies $51.2=\\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. If $51.2(n+1)=2^n$ and $n$ is a non-negative integer, we know that $2^n>51.2\\qquad\\Rightarrow n\\ge 6$. If $n=6$, $2^n=64$, but $51.2(7)$ is much greater than $64$ (we can estimate $51.2(7)$ with $50\\cdot7=350$). With $n=7$ and $n=8$, we also find that $51.2(n+1)$ is greater than $2^n$. When we try $n=9$, we get $51.2(10)=2^{9}=512$, which is true. The value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$. The answer is 9.",
  "There are a total of $2^6=64$ equally likely sequences of heads and tails coin flips.  Each toss corresponds to a movement clockwise or counterclockwise, so each sequence of coin tosses corresponds to a sequence of six movements, $L$ or $R$.  If the man gets six consecutive heads or tails, corresponding to $RRRRRR$ or $LLLLLL$, then he will return to the starting point.  But, the man could also flip three heads and three tails in some order, corresponding to a sequence like $RRLRLL$.

  "Note that there are $4! = 24$ numbers ending in 1, since we have 4 choices for the 10s digit, 3 choices for the 100s digit, 2 choices for the 1000s digit, and 1 choice for the remaining digit.  Thus there are also 24 numbers ending in each of 3, 4, 5, 9, and the total contribution of ones digits to the sum is $24 (1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9) = 528$.  But we can make a similar argument about the contribution of the digits in the other places (10s, 100s, etc.), so our total sum is $528 + 5280 + \\ldots + 5280000 = 528 (1 + 10 + \\ldots + 10000) = 528\\cdot 11,111 = \\boxed{5,\\!866,\\!608}$.

  "There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 5 \\times 6!}{8} = 5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.

  "Let $x$ be the probability we are looking for and $y$ be the probability that they both spin the same number. By symmetry, it's clear that the probability of Zack getting a larger number than Max does is also equal to $x$. Furthermore, all possible outcomes can be divided into three categories: Max gets a larger number than Zack does, Max and Zack get the same number, or Zack gets a larger number than Max. The sum of the probabilities of these three events is 1, which gives us the equation $x+y+x=1$.\n\nWe can calculate $y$ with a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{1}{4}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{16}$. The probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{1}{6}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{36}$ and the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{12}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{144}$.

  "After Gimli has flipped his coin 2008 times, the probability that he has more heads than Legolas is equal the probability that Legolas has more heads than him. Call this probability $p$. Then there is a $1-2p$ probability that they have the same number of heads. If Gimli already has more heads, he will have more heads after he flips again. If he has fewer heads, he cannot have more after just one more flip. If they are even, there is a $1/2$ chance he will flip another head, and therefore have more heads. In all, Gimli flips more heads than Legolas with probability $p+\\frac12(1-2p)=p+\\frac12-p=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$. The answer is \\frac{1}{2}.",

Therefore, we want to find the range of possible $x-$ and $y-$coordinates over all points on the ellipse.\n\nSubtracting $5$ from both sides, we can write the equation of the ellipse as a quadratic with $x$ as the variable: \\[x^2 - (2y)x + (3y^2-5) =0.\\]For a point $(x, y)$ to lie on the ellipse, this equation must have a real solution for $x.$ Therefore, the discriminant of the quadratic must be nonnegative: \\[(2y)^2 - 4(3y^2 - 5) \\ge 0,\\]or $-8y^2 + 20 \\ge 0.$ Solving for $y$ gives $-\\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2 \\le y \\le \\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2.$ Therefore, the equations of the two horizontal lines are $y = -\\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2$ and $y=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2.$\n\nWe can do the same, with the roles of the variables reversed, to find all possible values for $x.$ We write the equation of the ellipse as a quadratic in $y$, giving \\[3y^2 - (2x)y + (x^2-5) = 0.\\]The discriminant of this equation must be nonnegative, so we have \\[(2x)^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (x^2-5) \\ge 0,\\]or $-8x^2 + 60 \\ge 0.$ Solving for $x$ gives $-\\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2 \\le x \\le \\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2.$ Therefore, the equations of the two vertical lines are $x=-\\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2$ and $x=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2.$\n\nIt follows that the side lengths of the rectangle are $2 \\cdot \\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2 = \\sqrt{10}$ and $2 \\cdot \\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2 = \\sqrt{30},$ so the area of the rectangle is \\[\\sqrt{10}\\cdot \\sqrt{30} = \\boxed{10\\sqrt3}.\\] The answer is 10\\sqrt3.",

  "Since $f(x)$ has integer coefficients, the Integer Root Theorem tells us that all integer roots of $f(x)$ must divide the constant term $66=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$. Thus, the possible integer roots of $f(x)$ are\n$$\\pm 1,~\\pm 2,~\\pm 3,~\\pm 6,~\\pm 11,~\\pm 22,~\\pm 33,~\\pm 66.$$Moreover, since we know that all roots of $f(x)$ are integers, we know that all roots of $f(x)$ appear in the list above.\n\nNow we apply Vieta's formulas. The product of the roots of $f(x)$ is $(-1)^n\\cdot\\frac{a_0}{a_n}$, which is $33$ or $-33$. Also, the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}=-\\frac{a_{n-1}}2$. Thus, in order to minimize $|a_{n-1}|$, we should make the absolute value of the sum of the roots as small as possible, working under the constraint that the product of the roots must be $33$ or $-33$.\n\nWe now consider two cases.\n\nCase 1 is that one of $33,-33$ is a root, in which case the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$. In this case, the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $32$.\n\nThe alternative, Case 2, is that one of $11,-11$ is a root and one of $3,-3$ is a root. Again, the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$, so the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $11-3-1=7$, which is better than the result of Case 1. If the absolute value of the sum of the roots is $7$, then $|a_{n-1}|=7|a_n|=7\\cdot 2=14$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $|a_{n-1}|\\ge 14$, and we can check that equality is achieved by\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= 2(x+11)(x-3)(x-1) \\\\\n&= 2x^3+14x^2-82x+66,\n\\end{align*}which has integer coefficients and integer roots.

  "Let $h$ be the number of 4 unit line segments and $v$ be the number of 5 unit line segments. Then $4h+5v=2007$. Each pair of adjacent 4 unit line segments and each pair of adjacent 5 unit line segments determine one basic rectangle. Thus the number of basic rectangles determined is $B = (h - 1)(v - 1)$. To simplify the work, make the substitutions $x = h - 1$ and $y = v - 1$. The problem is now to maximize $B = xy$ subject to $4x + 5y = 1998$, where $x$, $y$ are integers. Solve the second equation for $y$ to obtain $$y =\n\\frac{1998}{5} - \\frac{4}{5}x,$$and substitute into $B=xy$ to obtain $$B = x\\left(\\frac{1998}{5} - \\frac{4}{5}x\\right).$$The graph of this equation is a parabola with $x$ intercepts 0 and 999/2. The vertex of the parabola is halfway between the intercepts, at $x = 999/4$. This is the point at which $B$ assumes its maximum.\n\nHowever, this corresponds to a nonintegral value of $x$ (and hence $h$). From $4x+5y = 1998$ both $x$ and $y$ are integers if and only if $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. The nearest such integer to $999/4 =\n249.75$ is $x = 252$.

  "The desired polynomials with $a_0 = -1$ are the negatives of those with $a_0 = 1,$ so consider $a_0 = 1.$  By Vieta's formulas, $-a_1$ is the sum of all the zeros, and $a_2$ is the sum of all possible pairwise products.
