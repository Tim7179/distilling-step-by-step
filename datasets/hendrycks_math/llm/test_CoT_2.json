  "Looking at the form of the equation, we see that we have two linear terms and their product.  We thus apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick.  The given equation rearranges to $6mn + 3m +2n +1 = 28$, which can be factored to $(3m + 1)(2n +1) = 28 = 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 7$.  Since $n$ is a positive integer, we see that $2n +1 > 1$ is odd.  Examining the factors on the right side, we see we must have $2n + 1 = 7$, implying $3m+1 = 2\\cdot 2$.  Solving, we find that $(m,n) = \\boxed{(1,3)}$. The answer is (1,3).",
  "Since the parabola is completely below the $x$-axis, it must open downwards (otherwise, it would have to cross the $x$ axis on its way up). This means $a<0$.

Since all solutions must be imaginary, the discriminant must be negative, or \\begin{align*}\nb^2-4ac&<0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb^2-4(-7)(-6)&<0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb^2-168&<0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb^2&<168.\n\\end{align*} This means that $-\\sqrt{168}<b<\\sqrt{168}$. The largest integral value of $b$ is the greatest integer less than $\\sqrt{168}$. Since $13^2=169$, we know $\\sqrt{168}$ is a little less than $13$ but more than $12$.

  "Suppose we consider the equation $y = (6x + 12)(x - 8)$, which is equivalent to $y = 6x^2 - 36x - 96$. Then the graph of this equation is a parabola opening upward, with a minimum at the vertex.

  "The sum of the first $n$ odd integers is $1 + 3 + \\dots + (2n - 1)$.

  "There are two ways to do this quickly: Set $\\frac{n^2-n}{2} = 55$, multiply both sides by 2, so that you have $n^2 - n = 110$.  Then, quickly notice that $n = 11$ is the only number conceivably close enough such that that equation will work (namely, $n = 10$ is too small, and $n = 12$ is too big, since 144 is way greater than 110.)  If you do the problem in this manner, you should do it all in your head so as to be able to do it more quickly (and you gain nothing from writing it out).\n\nThe other way is to quickly factor the numerator to $n(n-1)$, and once again multiply both sides by 2.  Then, you'll have $n(n-1) = 110$, from which you should recognize that both 10 and 11 are factors, from which you get $n = \\boxed{11}$.\n\nWe can also solve this as a quadratic equation. $n(n-1) = 110$ becomes $n^2 - n - 110 = 0$. Factoring, we find that $(n - 11)(n + 10) = 0.$ This gives us $n = 11$ or $n = -10,$ but $n$ must be positive, so $n = \\boxed{11}$. The answer is 11.",

  "One vertex of the triangle is on the vertex of the parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{-(-8)}{2(1)}=4$. To find the $y$-coordinate, we plug in $x=4$ to find $y=4^2-8\\cdot 4+5=16-32+5=-11$. So one vertex of the triangle is at $(4, -11)$.\n\nThe other two vertices are on the intersection of the parabola $y=x^2-8x+5$ and the line $y=k$. Thus we have $x^2-8x+5=k$ or $x^2-8x+(5-k)=0$. By the quadratic formula, the solutions to this equation are  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{-(-8)\\pm\\sqrt{(-8)^2-4(1)(5-k)}}{2(1)}&=\\frac{8\\pm\\sqrt{64-20+4k}}{2}\\\\\n&=4\\pm\\sqrt{11+k}.\n\\end{align*}So the two other vertices of the triangle are $(4-\\sqrt{11+k},k)$ and $(4+\\sqrt{11+k},k)$. Now, we know the triangle is equilateral. Since two vertices are on the same horizontal line, the side length is the difference of their $x$-coordinates, which is $(4+\\sqrt{11+k})-(4-\\sqrt{11+k})=2\\sqrt{11+k}$. The height of the equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times the side length, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2\\sqrt{11+k})=\\sqrt{3(11+k)}$. But the height is also the difference in the $y$-coordinate between the vertex and the horizontal side which is at $y=k$. This means the height is equal to $k-(-11)=k+11$, since $-11$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex. These heights must be equal, so we can write the equation \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{3(11+k)}&=k+11\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3(11+k)&=(k+11)^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n33+3k&=k^2+22k+121\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=k^2+19k+88\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(k+8)(k+11).\n\\end{align*}Thus we have $k=-8$ or $k=-11$. We can throw out $k=-11$ because then the line $y=-11$ intersects the parabola only once, at the vertex, so there's no triangle, just a point. Thus we have $k=\\boxed{-8}$. The answer is -8.",

  "The marked points are $(-5,-4),\\allowbreak (-2,5),\\allowbreak (-1,3),\\allowbreak (1,-5),\\allowbreak (3,2),\\allowbreak (5,2).$ Thus, the slopes of the segments are $$\\begin{array}{c c c}\n\\frac{(5)-(-4)}{(-2)-(-5)} = 3, &\\qquad \\frac{(3)-(5)}{(-1)-(-2)}=-2, \\qquad & \\frac{(-5)-(3)}{(1)-(-1)} = -4, \\\\\n\\\\\n\\frac{(2)-(-5)}{(3)-(1)} = 3.5, & \\frac{(2)-(2)}{(5)-(3)} = 0. &\n\\end{array}$$ If we graph $y=f(x)+cx,$ then the slope of each segment is increased by $c.$ For $f(x)+cx$ to be an invertible function, all the segments of its graph must have positive slope or all the segments of its graph must have negative slope. This guarantees that the function is either increasing for all $x$ in its domain or decreasing for all $x$ in its domain; either way, there is at most one input $x$ for each output. But if the graph of $f(x)$ has any segment of slope $0,$ then it cannot be invertible, and if it has segments of both positive and negative slope, then there is some \"V-shaped\" part of the graph where there are two points with the same $y$-coordinate.\n\nThe largest negative integer we can add to the slope of each segment to make all the slopes negative is $-4.$ The smallest positive integer we can add to the slope of each segment to make all the slopes positive is $5.$ Thus, $a=-4$ and $b=5,$ and $a^2+b^2=\\boxed{41}.$ The answer is 41.",

  "We have $p(2)=3$, but we have no information about how $p(x)$ acts when we put numbers like $2$ into it. We can only put outputs of $q(x)$ into $p(x)$. So, let's force $2$ to be an output of $q(x)$: Let $q(a)=2$ for some $a$.  Then we know $p(q(a))=4a+7$. But since $q(a)=2$, we really have $p(2)=4a+7$. But we're given that $p(2)=3$, so $3=4a+7$. Solving this gives $a=-1$ (so as it turns out, there was a value of $a$ for which $q(a)=2$.) By the definition of $a$, $q(a)=2$, so since $a=-1$, $q(-1)=2$. But that's exactly what we wanted to find!

Similarly, no factor can be $1$ because that would give either $z=-4$, $x=0$, or $y=-3$, none of which is allowable. There are only $3$ non-one factors which multiply to $847$, so in some order our three factors must be $7$, $11$, and $11$.\n\nWe examine the $3x+1$ term.

We are left with the expression\n\\[-3(p^2-40p+400)+1200=-3(p-20)^2+1200.\\]Note that the $-3(p-20)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative.

  "The three-digit number $abc$ is maximized when $a$ is maximized, and $a$ is maximized when $b$ is maximized, since 4, $a$, $b$ is a geometric sequence.  The largest digit is 9, so we'd like to find a digit $a$ such that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence.  The condition that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence is equivalent to $\\frac{9}{a}=\\frac{a}{4}$, which by clearing denominators is equivalent to $36=a^2$, which has solutions $a=\\pm 6$.  One of these solutions is a digit, so $a=6$ and $b=9$ are the maximum values of $a$ and $b$.  If $b$, $c$, 5 is an arithmetic sequence, then the $c$ equals the average of $b$ and $5$, which is $(9+5)/2=7$.  So, $abc=\\boxed{697}$. The answer is 697.",
  "Let $a$ denote the number of chocolate candies, $b$ the number of vanilla, $c$ the number of peppermint, and $d$ the number of lemon.

If either $(2x+3)$ or $(5y+7)$ equal 1, then $x$ or $y$ would be negative.  If $5y+7$ equals 11, then $y$ would not be an integer.  So, $5y+7=17$ and $2x+3=11$.  Solving for $(x,y)$ gives $(4,2)$.

  "Since $f$ and $g$ are inverses and $g(3) = 9$, we have $f(9) = 3$, so $f(f(9)) = f(3)$. Similarly, $g(0) = 3$, so $f(3) = \\boxed{0}$. The answer is 0.",
  "Since the fifth term is halfway between the first term and ninth term, it is simply the average of these terms, or \\[\\frac{2/3 + 4/5}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{15}}.\\] The answer is \\frac{11}{15}.",
  "Writing the equation $\\log_{64^{\\frac{1}{3}}}4^x=1$ in exponential form gives $(64^{\\frac{1}{3}})^1=4^x$. This can be rewritten as $4^{3^{(\\frac{1}{3})}}=4^{x}$, which means that $4^1=4^x$. Therefore, $x=\\boxed{1}$. The answer is 1."
