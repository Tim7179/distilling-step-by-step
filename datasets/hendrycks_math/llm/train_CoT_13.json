  "There are obviously 24 positive integers less than or equal to 24. Of them, we can count the divisors directly, or use the neat trick of prime factorizing $24 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1$. Considering that any divisor must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b$ where $0 \\le a \\le 3$ and $0 \\le b \\le 1$ so that there are $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ factors of 24.

  "Let's begin with the calculator that initially shows 1. Each time it is passed around the circle, it is cubed. 1 to any power is still 1, so no matter how many times 1 is cubed, the final result will still be 1.\n\nNow examine the calculator that starts with a zero. 0 squared is still 0 because 0 to any positive power is still 0.

Each time a person gets the calculator, they negate the number. Because there are 42 participants, there are 42 total turns. Thus, -1 is negated 42 times.

Thus the total number of arrangements is $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{120}$. The answer is 120.",

  "$40=2^3\\cdot5$ and $48=2^4\\cdot3$. The prime factorization of their greatest common factor cannot contain any other primes besides 2 raised to no more than the 3rd power, otherwise it would not be a factor of both numbers. Thus, their GCF is $2^3=\\boxed{8}$. The answer is 8.",
  "The first multiple of $10$ greater than $9$ is $10$, and the last multiple of $10$ less than $101$ is $100$. The list of multiples of $10$ proceeds: $10$, $20$, $\\ldots$, $100$. Divide each number by $10$, and the list becomes $1$, $2$, $\\ldots$, $10$. It is easy to see that the number of numbers in this list is $\\boxed{10}$. The answer is 10.",
  "There are 17 times, so the median time will be the ninth when the times are listed from least time to most time.  Fortunately, the stem-and-leaf plot gives us the times in order.  For example, the first time is 0 minutes and 28 seconds, the second time is also 0 minutes and 28 seconds, and so on.  The ninth time is 2 minutes and 43 seconds.  Converting to seconds gives $2 \\cdot 60 + 43 = \\boxed{163}$ seconds. The answer is 163.",

  "Choose $k$ so that the smallest angle measures $5k$ degrees.  Then the measures of the other two angles are $6k$ degrees and $7k$ degrees.  Since the measures of the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have $5k+6k+7k=180\\implies 18k=180\\implies k=10$.  The smallest angle measures $5k=5(10)=\\boxed{50}$ degrees.
