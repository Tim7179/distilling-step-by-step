  "For this problem, we can use similar triangles to find the point $Q$. First we draw the radius from the center to the point of tangency on each circle. We have created two right triangles, since we know that a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at a point of tangency. We also know that $\\angle AQB\\cong \\angle DQC$ since vertical angles are congruent. Since the right angles and vertical angles are congruent, $\\triangle AQB\\sim \\triangle DQC$ by the AA Similarity Theorem (if two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent, the triangles are similar triangles). If $b$ and $c$ represent the hypotenuses, we can set up a proportion since the ratio of two corresponding sides is constant. $$\\frac{b}{c}=\\frac{1}{2}\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\quad c=2b$$We also know that $b+c=6$, since the distance from $A$ to $D$ is 6 units. So we have $b+2b=6$, which means $b=2$.

  "This triangle's vertices are the intersection points of each pair of lines. The intersection point of $y=0$ and $y=x+4$ is (-4,0). The intersection point of $y=0$ and $x+3y=12$ is (12,0). To find the intersection of the last 2 lines, we substitute the first equation for $y$ and then solve for $x$. Doing so, we get \\begin{align*}\nx+3y&=12 \\\\\nx+3(x+4)&=12 \\\\\nx+3x+12 &= 12 \\\\\n4x &=0 \\\\\nx &=0\n\\end{align*} Thus, $y=4$, and the intersection point is (0,4).

The height of each pyramid must be less than $36$, since the height of each pyramid extends from $O$ to a point inside the sphere. Therefore, the volume of each pyramid is less than $12$ times the area of the base. It follows that the volume of $P$ is less than $12$ times the surface area of $P$. We can, however, make this ratio arbitrarily close to $12$ by selecting polyhedra $P$ with many small faces, so that the height of each pyramid is as close as we wish to $36$.\n\nTherefore, for polyhedra inscribed in a sphere of radius $36$ such that the center of the sphere lies inside the polyhedron, the least upper bound on $$\\frac{\\text{volume of }P}{\\text{surface area of }P}$$is $12$. Finally, we must consider the case of inscribed polyhedra for which the center of the sphere does not lie inside the polyhedron. However, in this case, we can still construct pyramids with apex $O$ whose bases are the faces of $P$; then the surface area of $P$ is still the sum of the areas of the bases, but the volume of $P$ is less than the total volume of the pyramids. This only strengthens the argument for an upper bound of $12$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$. The answer is 12.",

Therefore, $MN$ is perpendicular to $DF,$ and $MN =\\sqrt{3}DN = 2\\sqrt{3}.$\n\nNext, we calculate $CP.$ We know that $QC = 8$ and $\\angle QCP = 60^\\circ.$ Since $MN\\perp DF,$ plane $MNPQ$ is perpendicular to plane $BCDF.$ Since $QP || MN$ (they lie in the same plane $MNPQ$ and in parallel planes $ACB$ and $DEF$), $QP \\perp CB.$\n\nTherefore, $\\triangle QCP$ is right-angled at $P$ and contains a $60^\\circ$ angle, so is also a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle. It follows that $$CP = \\frac{1}{2}(CQ)=\\frac{1}{2}(8)=4$$and $QP = \\sqrt{3} CP = 4\\sqrt{3}.$\n\nThen, we construct.

The parallelogram $AD_3BC$ has the same perimeter as the parallelogram $ABCD_2$ by symmetry, so we disregard point $D_3$.\n\nWe will find the perimeter of $ABCD_2$. To calculate where point $D_2$ is, we notice that $AD_2$ must be parallel to the vertical segment $BC$, so the $x$ value of point $D_2$ must be $-1$. In addition, the length $AD_2$ must be equal to the length $BC$, which is 8. Thus, the $y$ value of point $D_2$ must be $-8$. So point $D_2$ is at $(-1,-8)$. The vertical segments of parallelogram $ABCD_2$ have length 8. To find the length of the diagonal segments $AB$ and $CD_2$, we use the distance formula between points $A$ and $B$: $AB=\\sqrt{(-1-2)^2+(0-4)^2}=5$. Thus, the perimeter of this parallelogram is $8+8+5+5=26$.\n\nWe will find the perimeter of $ABD_1C$. To calculate where point $D_1$ is, we note that since figure $ABC$ is symmetric about the $x$-axis, $D_1$ must lie on the $x$-axis, so its $y$ value is 0. We also know that the diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, so in order for diagonal $AD_1$ to bisect $BC$ (which crosses the $x$-axis at $x=2$), the $x$ value of $D_1$ must be 5. So point $D_1$ is at $(5,0)$. In finding the perimeter, we note that all the sides are equal in length. Since we already found side $AB$ to have length 5, the entire perimeter is $5\\cdot4=20$.\n\nThus, the positive difference between the greatest perimeter and the smallest is $26-20=\\boxed{6}$ units.

There are also 2 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect fifth powers which are $1^{10} = 1$ and $2^{10} = 1024$. The only number which is both a perfect cube and a perfect fifth power is $1^{15}=1$. The only number which is a perfect square, perfect cube, and perfect fifth power all at the same time is $1^{30}=1$.

  "The easiest solution is to find the number of positive integers with only 2 and 3 as their prime factors.

  "There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace.

So there would seem to be $20+7=27$ numbers less than 441 which are either perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\nBut wait! $1=1^2=1^3$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, so we've accidentally counted it twice.

Thus, there are $27-2=25$ numbers less than 441 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Also, since $20^2=400$ and $7^3=343$, then all 25 of these numbers are no more than 400. To compensate for these twenty-five numbers missing from the list, we need to add the next twenty-five numbers: 401, 402, $\\ldots$, 424, 425, none of which are perfect square or perfect cubes.

  "There are $\\binom{12}{5}=792$ equally likely choices for the set of 5 CDs Carlos purchases.  Of these, $\\binom{9}{5}$ include no heavy metal CDs, $\\binom{8}{5}$ include no rap CDs, and $\\binom{7}{5}$ include no country CDs.  We can add these numbers to find the number of sets of CDs which do not include at least one CD from each category, except that we have counted the set of 5 country CDs twice, since it omits both heavy metal and rap.

  "We can choose two numbers in $\\binom{99}{2}=4851$ ways. Two numbers will have a product which is a multiple of 3 if at least one of them is a multiple of 3.

  "After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row.

In the other $5^4-5-20=600$ cases, we quadruple-count the colorings, since there are four of the original colorings that are really the same.

  "We can solve this problem by dividing it into cases. If Markov rolls a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will flip a coin on the second turn. He must flip a heads to flip a coin on his third turn. There is a $\\frac{2}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{6}$ chance of this case happening. If Markov does not roll a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will roll the die on the second turn. He must roll a 1 or 2 on the second turn to flip a coin on the third turn. There is a $\\frac{4}{6}\\cdot \\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{2}{9}$ chance of this case happening. The total probability that Markov will flip a coin on the third turn is then $\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{2}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{18}}$. The answer is \\frac{7}{18}.",
  "The original rectangle may be subdivided into four smaller congruent rectangles, all sharing $O$ as a vertex. Each of these rectangles is analogous, so we can consider our random point $P$ to be without loss of generality in the smaller rectangle with $A$ as a vertex. All points in this smaller rectangle are closer to $A$ than they are to $B$, $C$, or $D$, so we just need to determine the probability that $OP<AP$.

  "We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\\binom{26}5-2\\cdot4\\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\\binom{52}5$ to get $$\\frac{6\\cdot26\\cdot25\\cdot24\\cdot23\\cdot22-8\\cdot13\\cdot12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot9}{52\\cdot51\\cdot50\\cdot49\\cdot48}=\\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\\frac{88}{595}=\\boxed{\\frac{507}{595}}$. The answer is \\frac{507}{595}.",
  "The probability that the first card is a $\\heartsuit$ is $\\dfrac14$. The second card then has a probability of $\\dfrac{13}{51}$ of being $\\clubsuit$.  So the answer is $\\dfrac14 \\times \\dfrac{13}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{204}}$. The answer is \\dfrac{13}{204}.",

  "No matter what the result of the first roll is, there are 6 equally likely possibilities for the second roll, only one of which is the same as the first roll.  Therefore, the probability that the dice show the same number is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$. The answer is \\frac{1}{6}.",
  "We count the complement. A cube that does not touch the bottom or a lateral side either touches only the top side or no sides at all. These cubes form a $2\\times2\\times3$ prism, giving 12 cubes. These 12 cubes are subtracted from 64 to leave $\\boxed{52}$. The answer is 52.",

  "We can arrange the books on the shelf, pretending that the two math books are actually one book because they must be next to each other. In exactly half of these arrangements, the math books will be to the left of the physics book, giving $6!/2=360$ arrangements.

  "There are 5 white balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a white ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$.  Similarly, the probability that a black ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$.

  "Let $x$ be the number of students taking physics, so the number in chemistry is $2x$.  There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \\[\n(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.\n\\] We solve for $x$ and find that the number of physics students is $x = \\boxed{110}$.
