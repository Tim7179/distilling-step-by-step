  "Since the given segments are perpendicular, we have two consecutive right angles. Since $AB\\ne DC$, we know the quadrilateral is not a rectangle. After drawing the three given sides connected by two right angles, we connect $A$ and $D$ to create a trapezoid. If we extend $\\overline{DC}$ to complete the rectangle, we create a right triangle to help find the length of $\\overline{AD}$. We had to extend $\\overline{DC}$ by 5 units since $\\overline{AB}$ is 5 units longer than $\\overline{DC}$. The bottom leg of the triangle is the same length as $\\overline{BC}$ since they are opposite sides of a rectangle. So we have a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12. We could use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the length of the hypotenuse, or we recognize that 5 and 12 are part of the Pythagorean triple $(5,12,13)$. So the length of the hypotenuse $\\overline{AD}$ is 13 units.

The sum of the digits in each of Luna's numbers is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$, which is divisible by 3, so each of Luna's numbers is divisible by 3.\n\nThe smallest number in Luna's list is 12345, which is not divisible by 2.  The next smallest number in Luna's list is 12354, which is divisible by 2, so the answer is $\\boxed{12354}$. The answer is 12354.",

  "We have an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 units and legs of 3 units each. We know that with an isosceles triangle, the altitude bisects the base.

For each of the right triangles, the hypotenuse is 3 units, while one of the legs is 2 units, half of the isosceles triangle's base. We solve for the length of the other leg (the height of the isosceles triangle) with the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2=c^2-b^2$, so $a^2=3^2-2^2$ and $a=\\sqrt{5}$.

So, the inequality says that $$16-4n > 10.$$ To solve this inequality, we can start by subtracting $10$ from both sides: $$6-4n > 0.$$ Then we add $4n$ to both sides: $$6 > 4n.$$ Finally, we divide both sides by $4$ to get $$1\\dfrac 12 > n.$$ The only positive integer satisfying this inequality is $n=1$, so there is $\\boxed{1}$ such number.

  "$1337$ happens to be divisible by $7$. A fairly fast way to see this might be to note that $140-7=133$ is divisible by $7$, so $1330$ must be as well.  Therefore, so is $1330+7= 1337$. Divide $1337$ by $7$ to get 191.  Since 191 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, and $17^2 = 289$ is greater than 191, we know that $191$ is prime.  So, the prime factorization of 1337 is $7\\cdot 191$, which means the largest prime factor of 1337 is $\\boxed{191}$. The answer is 191.",
