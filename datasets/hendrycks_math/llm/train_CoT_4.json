  "First, consider the tangent line to the parabola at $(2,4).$  The equation of this tangent is of the form\n\\[y - 4 = m(x - 2).\\]Setting $y = x^2,$ we get $x^2 - 4 = m(x - 2),$ or $x^2 - mx + 2m - 4 = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, $x = 2$ is a double root of this quadratic.  In other words, this quadratic is identical to $(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4.$  Hence, $m = 4.$\n\nLet the center of the circle be $(a,b).$  The line joining the center $(a,b)$ and $(2,4)$ is the perpendicular to the tangent line, which means its slope is $-\\frac{1}{4}.$  This gives us the equation\n\\[\\frac{b - 4}{a - 2} = -\\frac{1}{4}.\\]Since the points $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$ are on the circle, they must be equidistant from its center. The set of all points equidistant from $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$ is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$. Therefore, the center of the circle must lie on the  perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$. The midpoint of this line segment is $\\left( 1, \\frac{5}{2} \\right),$ and its slope is\n\\[\\frac{4 - 1}{2 - 0} = \\frac{3}{2}.\\]Hence, $(a,b)$ must satisfy\n\\[\\frac{b - 5/2}{a - 1} = -\\frac{2}{3}.\\]So,\n\\begin{align*}\nb - 4 &= -\\frac{1}{4} (a - 2), \\\\\nb - \\frac{5}{2} &= -\\frac{2}{3} (a - 1).\n\\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $(a,b) = \\boxed{\\left( -\\frac{16}{5}, \\frac{53}{10} \\right)}.$ The answer is \\left( -\\frac{16}{5}, \\frac{53}{10} \\right).",

Luckily, we have a pretty good idea what they look like.\n\nWe are looking for rational $a$ and $b$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt 5)^2 = 180 + 80\\sqrt 5$. Expanding the left hand side and comparing coefficients, we get $ab=40$ and $a^2 + 5b^2 = 180$. We can easily guess (or compute) the solution $a=10$, $b=4$.\n\nHence $180 + 80\\sqrt 5 = (10 + 4\\sqrt 5)^2$, and we can also easily verify that $180 - 80\\sqrt 5 = (10 - 4\\sqrt 5)^2$.\n\nWe now know the complete factorization of $f(x)$: \\begin{align*}\nf(x) = (x - 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)\n\\end{align*}As the final step, we can now combine the factors in a different way, in order to get rid of the square roots.\n\nWe have $(x - 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\\sqrt 5) = (x-10)^2 - (4\\sqrt 5)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 20$, and $(x + 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\\sqrt 5) = x^2 + 20x + 20$.\n\nHence we obtain the factorization $f(x) = (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20)$.\n\nFor $x\\geq 20$, both terms are positive and larger than one, hence $f(x)$ is not prime. For $1<x<19$, the second factor is positive and the first one is negative, hence $f(x)$ is not prime. The remaining cases are $x=1$ and $x=19$. In both cases, $f(x)$ is indeed a prime, and their sum is $f(1) + f(19) = 41 + 761 = \\boxed{802}$. The answer is 802.",
  "Because the given quadratic has leading coefficient $1$, both factors must be of the form $x-c$ (or $-x+c$). Therefore, such a factorization exists if and only if $x^2 + ax + b$ has two integer roots. Letting $r$ and $s$ denote these roots, we have, by Vieta's formulas, \\[\\begin{aligned} r+s &= -a, \\\\ rs &= b. \\end{aligned}\\]Since $r+s = -a$ is negative but $rs = b$ is nonnegative, it follows that both $r$ and $s$ must be negative or zero. Now, for each $a$, there are $a+1$ possible pairs $(r, s)$, which are $(0, -a)$, $(-1, -a+1)$, $\\ldots$, $(-a, 0)$. However, since the order of $r$ and $s$ does not matter, we only get $\\lceil \\tfrac{a+1}{2} \\rceil$ distinct polynomials $x^2+ax+b$ for each possible value of $a$. It follows that the number of these polynomials is \\[\\sum_{a=1}^{100} \\left\\lceil \\frac{a+1}{2} \\right\\rceil = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + \\dots + 50 + 50 + 51 = \\boxed{2600}\\]since if we pair up the terms in this sum end-to-end, each pair has a sum of $52 = 2 \\cdot 26$.

  "We could solve this problem using casework, but using a little bit of symmetry and complementary probability gives us a more elegant solution. Since each coin flips heads or tails with equal probability, by the principle of symmetry the probability of getting fewer heads than tails is the equal to the probability of getting fewer tails than heads. Additionally, there are only three possible outcomes: getting fewer heads than tails, getting fewer tails than heads, or getting the same number of both. If we let $x$ represent the probability of the first outcome (which is the same as the probability of the second outcome) and $y$ represent the probability of the third outcome, we get the equation $2x + y = 1 \\Rightarrow x=\\dfrac{1-y}{2}$. So all we need to do is calculate the probability of getting the same number of heads and tails and we can then easily solve for what we want using the principle of complementary probability.

  "If the product of their values is even, then at least one of the dice rolls must yield an even number. To find how many ways this is possible, we consider the complementary possibility: suppose that all of the dice rolls yield odd numbers. There are $3^4$ ways of this occurring, out of a total of $6^4$ possibilities. It follows that there are $6^4 - 3^4$ ways of obtaining at least one even value.\n\nNow, we need to count how many ways we can obtain an odd sum. There must then be an odd number of odd numbers rolled, so there must be either one or three odd numbers rolled. If one odd number is rolled, then there are $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the odd number, and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding a total of $4 \\cdot 3^4$ possibilities. If three odd numbers are rolled, then there are again $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the even number and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding $4 \\cdot 3^4$.

  "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is greater than or equal to 11.

So, the number of ways to choose $a$ and $b$ so the product is $\\textit{not}$ a multiple of 5 is $\\binom{40}{2}=780$.  Therefore, there are $1225-780=445$ ways to choose $a$ and $b$ that do satisfy the requirement, which gives a probability of: $$\\frac{445}{1225}=\\boxed{\\frac{89}{245}}$$ The answer is \\frac{89}{245}.",

  "We can think of the $3$ basic flavors as $3$ distinguishable boxes, and the $4$ scoops as $4$ indistinguishable balls. For every ball we put in the chocolate box, for instance, we put a scoop of chocolate ice cream in the blending machine. In this way we can correlate each new flavor with an arrangement of balls in boxes. So the number of different new flavors is the number of ways to put the balls into the boxes.\n\nWe can solve this as a \"sticks and dots'' problem. Consider $4$ indistinguishable balls and $2$ indistinguishable sticks. Arrange them in a line. Fill the boxes by putting all the balls to left of the leftmost stick in the chocolate box, the balls between the two sticks in the vanilla box, and the balls to the right of the rightmost stick in the strawberry box.

This has probability $\\frac{1}{6^4}$ of occurring.\nCase 2: Two 5's are rolled.\nCase 3: No 5's are rolled.\nTo find the number of outcomes for the latter two cases, we will use recursion. Consider a 5-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. For $n \\ge 1$, let $a_n$ equal the number of outcomes after rolling the die $n$ times, with the property that the product is a square. Thus, $a_1 = 2$ as 1 and 4 are the only possibilities.\nTo find $a_{n+1}$ given $a_n$ (where $n \\ge 1$), we observe that if the first $n$ rolls multiply to a perfect square, then the last roll must be 1 or 4. This gives $2a_n$ outcomes. Otherwise, the first $n$ rolls do not multiply to a perfect square ($5^n - a_n$ outcomes). In this case, we claim that the last roll is uniquely determined (either 2, 3, or 6). If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3. Thus, we have $5^n - a_n$ outcomes in this case, and $a_{n+1} = 2a_n + (5^n - a_n) = 5^n + a_n$.\nComputing $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ gives $a_2 = 7$, $a_3 = 32$, and $a_4 = 157$.

Denote $a_1$ as $2^{b_1} \\cdot 5^{c_1}$, $a_2$ as $2^{b_2} \\cdot 5^{c_2}$, and $a_3$ as $2^{b_3} \\cdot 5^{c_3}$.\nIn order for $a_1$ to divide $a_2$, and for $a_2$ to divide $a_3$, $b_1\\le b_2\\le b_3$, and $c_1\\le c_2\\le c_3$. We will consider each case separately. Note that the total amount of possibilities is $190^3$, as there are $(18+1)(9+1)=190$ choices for each factor.\nWe notice that if we add $1$ to $b_2$ and $2$ to $b_3$, then we can reach the stronger inequality $0\\le b_1<b_2+1<b_3+2\\le 20$. Therefore, if we pick $3$ integers from $0$ to $20$, they will correspond to a unique solution, forming a 1-1 correspondence between the numbers $b_1$, $b_2+1$, and $b_3+2$. This is also equivalent to applying stars and bars on distributing the powers of 2 and 5 through differences. The amount of solutions to this inequality is $\\dbinom{21}{3}$.\nThe case for $c_1$,$c_2$, and $c_3$ proceeds similarly for a result of $\\dbinom{12}{3}$. Therefore, the probability of choosing three such factors is\\[\\frac{\\dbinom{21}{3} \\cdot \\dbinom{12}{3}}{190^3}.\\]Simplification gives $\\frac{77}{1805}$, and therefore the answer is $\\boxed{77}$. The answer is 77.",
  "Suppose that the two identical digits are both $1$. Since the thousands digit must be $1$, only one of the other three digits can be $1$. This means the possible forms for the number are\n$11xy,\\qquad 1x1y,\\qquad1xy1$\nBecause the number must have exactly two identical digits, $x\\neq y$, $x\\neq1$, and $y\\neq1$. Hence, there are $3\\cdot9\\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.\nNow suppose that the two identical digits are not $1$. Reasoning similarly to before, we have the following possibilities:\n$1xxy,\\qquad1xyx,\\qquad1yxx.$\nAgain, $x\\neq y$, $x\\neq 1$, and $y\\neq 1$. There are $3\\cdot9\\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.\nThus the answer is $216+216=\\boxed{432}$. The answer is 432.",
  "Let $S$ be a non- empty subset of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\nThen the alternating sum of $S$, plus the alternating sum of $S \\cup \\{7\\}$, is $7$. This is because, since $7$ is the largest element, when we take an alternating sum, each number in $S$ ends up with the opposite sign of each corresponding element of $S\\cup \\{7\\}$.\nBecause there are $2^{6}=64$ of these pairs of sets, the sum of all possible subsets of our given set is $64 \\cdot 7$, giving an answer of $\\boxed{448}$. The answer is 448.",
  "We can use complementary counting, by finding the probability that none of the three knights are sitting next to each other and subtracting it from $1$.\nImagine that the $22$ other (indistinguishable) people are already seated, and fixed into place.\nWe will place $A$, $B$, and $C$ with and without the restriction.\nThere are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $21$ places to put $B$, and $20$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$. Hence, there are $22\\cdot21\\cdot20$ ways to place $A, B, C$ in between these people with restrictions.\nWithout restrictions, there are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $23$ places to put $B$, and $24$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$. Hence, there are $22\\cdot23\\cdot24$ ways to place $A,B,C$ in between these people without restrictions.\nThus, the desired probability is $1-\\frac{22\\cdot21\\cdot20}{22\\cdot23\\cdot24}=1-\\frac{420}{552}=1-\\frac{35}{46}=\\frac{11}{46}$, and the answer is $11+46=\\boxed{57}$.

  "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer. The answer is 61.",
  "First notice that there is no difference between the maple trees and the oak trees; we have only two types, birch trees and \"non-birch\" trees. (If you don't believe this reasoning, think about it. You could also differentiate the tall oak trees from the short oak trees, and the maple trees with many branches as opposed to those with few branches. Indeed, you could keep dividing until you have them each in their own category, but in the end it will not change the probability of the birch trees being near each other. That is, in the end, you multiply the numerator by the number of ways to arrange the oak and maple trees and you also multiply the denominator by the number of ways to arrange the oak and maple trees, making them cancel out.)\nThe five birch trees must be placed amongst the seven previous trees. We can think of these trees as 5 dividers of 8 slots that the birch trees can go in, making ${8\\choose5} = 56$ different ways to arrange this.\nThere are ${12 \\choose 5} = 792$ total ways to arrange the twelve trees, so the probability is $\\frac{56}{792} = \\frac{7}{99}$.\nThe answer is $7 + 99 = \\boxed{106}$. The answer is 106.",
  "Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$. The answer is 182.",
  "Because the octahedron is symmetric and all vertices have the same number of edges, we can assume that the first vertex we choose is the top one. If we do not choose this vertex, we can simply rotate the octahedron so that we have. From here, there are 5 other vertices. 4 of them share an edge with the vertex we have already chosen, so the probability that the 2 vertices chosen form an edge is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$. The answer is \\frac{4}{5}."
