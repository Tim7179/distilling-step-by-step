  "We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\sqrt[3]{64} = \\boxed{4}$. The answer is 4.",
  "If we fix $b$ then increasing $n$ increases the number of factors, so we want $n$ to equal $15$.  Recall that the number of prime factors of $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_m^{e_m}$ equals $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_m+1)$, where the $p_i$ are primes.  Thus we want the exponents in the prime factorization of $b$ to be as large as possible.  Choosing $b=12=2^2\\cdot 3$ gives $e_1=2,e_2=1$.  Any other number less than or equal to $15$ will either be prime or will be the product of two primes, giving smaller exponents in the prime factorization.  Thus $b=12$ is the best choice, and we have $b^n=2^{30}3^{15}$, which has $(30+1)(15+1)=\\boxed{496}$ positive factors. The answer is 496.",

  "We see that the largest power of 5 that is less than 1357 is $5^4=625$, and the largest multiple of 625 less than 1357 is 1250, or $2\\cdot625$.

Next, the largest power of five that is less than $107-100=7$ is $5^1=5$, simply giving us 5 or $1\\cdot 5$ as the largest multiple of 5.

  "We start working from the rightmost column. Since $5>2$, $A_6+B_6+5_6$ is either equal to $12_6$ or $22_6$. Therefore, $A_6+B_6$ is either equal to $3_6$ or $13_6$.\n\nWe then look at the second rightmost digits. If $A_6+B_6=13_6$, then $2_6+B_6+1_6+1_6=5_6$. This means that $B_6=1$, which makes $A_6=12_6$. Since $A$ has to be a single-digit integer, this is impossible. Therefore, we try $A_6+B_6=3_6$. This gives us $1_6+B_6+1_6+1_6=5_6$, which means $B_6=2$, and $A_6=1_6$.

  "To find the base $7$ representation of $777_{10}$, we first write $777$ as the sum of powers of $7$. To begin, we find that the largest power of $7$ that is less than $777$ is $7^3 = 343$. The largest multiple of $343$ that is less than $777$ is $2 \\cdot 343 = 686$, so we have $777 = 2 \\cdot 343 + 91$. We then consider the remainder $91$. The largest power of $7$ that is less than $91$ is $7^2 = 49$ and the largest multiple of $49$ that is less than $91$ is $1 \\cdot 49 = 49$. This leaves us with $91 - 49 = 42$, which can be expressed as $6 \\cdot 7^1$. Thus, we have $$777 = 2 \\cdot 7^3 + 1 \\cdot 7^2 + 6 \\cdot 7^1 + 0 \\cdot 7^0.$$Our base $7$ representation of $777_{10}$ is then $2160_7$.

  "The largest power of $6$ that is less than or equal to $314$ is $6^3$, which equals $216$. Because $(1\\cdot 6^3)=216<314<(2\\cdot 6^3)=432$, the digit in the $6^3$ place is $1$.

  "Let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits of $n$. It turns out that $n-f(n)$ is always divisible by 9. As a proof, write $n = a_k10^k + a_{k-1}10^{k-1}+ \\cdots + a_{1}10^1 + a_0$. Therefore, $n - f(n) = a_k(10^k - 1) + a_{k-1}(10^{k-1} - 1) + \\cdots + a_2(10^2-1) + a_1(10-1)$. Note that, in general, $10^n - 1$ is divisible by 9 because $10^n-1$ is actually a string of $n$ 9's. Therefore, we can factor a 9 out of the right-hand side, so $n-f(n)$ is always divisible by 9. Note furthermore that $n-f(n)$ is always nonnegative, and that $f(n)$ and $n$ share the same remainder when divided by 9 (these are corollaries, the first coming from observation, the second being a direct result of the proof).\n\nNow, consider $f(a_n)$, which is divisible by 9 if and only if $a_n$ is. We have $f(a_n) = f(1) + f(2) + \\cdots + f(n-1) + f(n)$. Since $f(k)$ and $k$ have the same remainder when divided by 9, so we can substitute $k$ for $f(k)$ in each term without changing the remainder when divided by 9. Therefore, $f(a_k) \\equiv \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\pmod 9$, which implies that we need either $k$ or $k+1$ to be divisible by 9. This happens either when $k$ is a multiple of 9 or when $k$ is one less than a multiple of 9. There are 11 multiples of 9 less than or equal to 100, and since 100 is not a multiple of 9, there are also 11 numbers which are one less than a multiple of 9 between 1 and 100. Therefore, there are $11 + 11 = \\boxed{22}$ values of $a_k$ that are divisible by 9 for $1 \\le k \\le 100$. The answer is 22.",

  "If $n$ is prime, then $f(n) = n+1$. If $n+1$ is prime, then $n$ must be even. Therefore, the only prime value of $n$ for which $n+1$ is prime is $n = 2$. If $n = p^a$ for some prime $p$ and an integer $a > 1$, then $f(n) = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}$. This value is not guaranteed to be composite, so we must check all powers of primes. Checking powers of $2$ first, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, and $f(16) = 31$. Two of these powers of 2 work. Checking powers of $3$, $f(9) = 13$ and $f(27)$ is beyond our boundary for $n$, so one power of $3$ works. Finally, $f(25) = 31$, which gives one more value of $n$ that works. Finally, if $n$ is any other composite integer, it can be written as the product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$.

If $n$ has $a$ digits equal to 8, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $8a$. For this number to be divisible by 3, $a$ must be divisible by 3. We also know that $a>0$ since $n$ is positive.

  "If $(x,y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$, then we have $d_n=(a_n,a_{n+1})=(100+n^2,100+n^2+2n+1)$. Now assuming that $d_n$ divides $100+n^2$, it must divide $2n+1$ if it is going to divide the entire expression $100+n^2+2n+1$.\nThus the equation turns into $d_n=(100+n^2,2n+1)$. Now note that since $2n+1$ is odd for integral $n$, we can multiply the left integer, $100+n^2$, by a power of two without affecting the greatest common divisor. Since the $n^2$ term is quite restrictive, let's multiply by $4$ so that we can get a $(2n+1)^2$ in there.\nSo $d_n=(4n^2+400,2n+1)=((2n+1)^2-4n+399,2n+1)=(-4n+399,2n+1)$. It simplified the way we wanted it to! Now using similar techniques we can write $d_n=(-2(2n+1)+401,2n+1)=(401,2n+1)$. Thus $d_n$ must divide $\\boxed{401}$ for every single $n$.

We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$. 19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$.

However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.

  "A positive integer $n$ has exactly two 1s in its binary representation exactly when $n = 2^j + 2^k$ for $j \\neq k$ nonnegative integers.

(The second condition ensures simultaneously that $j \\neq k$ and that each such number less than $2^{40}$ is counted exactly once.) This means there are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total such numbers.\nNow, consider the powers of $2$ mod $9$: $2^{6n} \\equiv 1, 2^{6n + 1} \\equiv 2, 2^{6n + 2} \\equiv 4, 2^{6n + 3} \\equiv 8 \\equiv -1,$ $2^{6n + 4} \\equiv 7 \\equiv -2,$ $2^{6n + 5} \\equiv 5 \\equiv -4 \\pmod 9$.\nIt's clear what the pairs $j, k$ can look like.

  "Suppose we require $a$ $7$s, $b$ $77$s, and $c$ $777$s to sum up to $7000$ ($a,b,c \\ge 0$). Then $7a + 77b + 777c = 7000$, or dividing by $7$, $a + 11b + 111c = 1000$. Then the question is asking for the number of values of $n = a + 2b + 3c$.\nManipulating our equation, we have $a + 2b + 3c = n = 1000 - 9(b + 12c) \\Longrightarrow 0 \\le 9(b+12c) < 1000$. Thus the number of potential values of $n$ is the number of multiples of $9$ from $0$ to $1000$, or $112$.\nHowever, we forgot to consider the condition that $a \\ge 0$. For a solution set $(b,c): n=1000-9(b+12c)$, it is possible that $a = n-2b-3c < 0$ (for example, suppose we counted the solution set $(b,c) = (1,9) \\Longrightarrow n = 19$, but substituting into our original equation we find that $a = -10$, so it is invalid). In particular, this invalidates the values of $n$ for which their only expressions in terms of $(b,c)$ fall into the inequality $9b + 108c < 1000 < 11b + 111c$.\nFor $1000 - n = 9k \\le 9(7 \\cdot 12 + 11) = 855$, we can express $k$ in terms of $(b,c): n \\equiv b \\pmod{12}, 0 \\le b \\le 11$ and $c = \\frac{n-b}{12} \\le 7$ (in other words, we take the greatest possible value of $c$, and then \"fill in\" the remainder by incrementing $b$). Then $11b + 111c \\le 855 + 2b + 3c \\le 855 + 2(11) + 3(7) = 898 < 1000$, so these values work.\nSimilarily, for $855 \\le 9k \\le 9(8 \\cdot 12 + 10) = 954$, we can let $(b,c) = (k-8 \\cdot 12,8)$, and the inequality $11b + 111c \\le 954 + 2b + 3c \\le 954 + 2(10) + 3(8) = 998 < 1000$. However, for $9k \\ge 963 \\Longrightarrow n \\le 37$, we can no longer apply this approach.\nSo we now have to examine the numbers on an individual basis. For $9k = 972$, $(b,c) = (0,9)$ works. For $9k = 963, 981, 990, 999 \\Longrightarrow n = 37, 19, 10, 1$, we find (using that respectively, $b = 11,9,10,11 + 12p$ for integers $p$) that their is no way to satisfy the inequality $11b + 111c < 1000$.\nThus, the answer is $112 - 4 = \\boxed{108}$.

  "Denote the number of bananas the first monkey took from the pile as $b_1$, the second $b_2$, and the third $b_3$; the total is $b_1 + b_2 + b_3$.

Thus the prime factorization of $2004^{2004}$ is $2^{4008}\\cdot 3^{2004}\\cdot 167^{2004}$.\nWe can count the number of divisors of a number by multiplying together one more than each of the exponents of the prime factors in its prime factorization. For example, the number of divisors of $2004=2^2\\cdot 3^1\\cdot 167^1$ is $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$.\nA positive integer divisor of $2004^{2004}$ will be of the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 167^c$.

So let's partition the 2's first. There are two 2's so this is equivalent to partitioning two items in three containers. We can do this in ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways.

  "It is well-known that $\\tau(n)$ is odd if and only if $n$ is a perfect square. (Otherwise, we can group divisors into pairs whose product is $n$.) Thus, $S(n)$ is odd if and only if there are an odd number of perfect squares less than $n$. So $S(1), S(2)$ and $S(3)$ are odd, while $S(4), S(5), \\ldots, S(8)$ are even, and $S(9), \\ldots, S(15)$ are odd, and so on.\nSo, for a given $n$, if we choose the positive integer $m$ such that $m^2 \\leq n < (m + 1)^2$ we see that $S(n)$ has the same parity as $m$.\nIt follows that the numbers between $1^2$ and $2^2$, between $3^2$ and $4^2$, and so on, all the way up to the numbers between $43^2$ and $44^2 = 1936$ have $S(n)$ odd. These are the only such numbers less than $2005$ (because $45^2 = 2025 > 2005$).\nNotice that the difference between consecutive squares are consecutively increasing odd numbers. Thus, there are $3$ numbers between $1$ (inclusive) and $4$ (exclusive), $5$ numbers between $4$ and $9$, and so on. The number of numbers from $n^2$ to $(n + 1)^2$ is $(n + 1 - n)(n + 1 + n) = 2n + 1$. Whenever the lowest square beneath a number is odd, the parity will be odd, and the same for even.

Notice that if we align the two and subtract, we get that each difference is equal to $2$. Thus, the solution is $|a - b| = |b - a| = |2 \\cdot 21 + 70 - 87| = \\boxed{25}$. The answer is 25.",
  "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$. The answer is 294.",

Thus by the above formula, the highest power of $2$ that divides $S_n$ is $2^{k+n-1}$. For $S_n$ to be a perfect square, $k+n-1$ must be even. If $k$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even, hence $k+n-1$ is odd, and $S_n$ cannot be a perfect square. Hence $k$ must be even. In particular, as $n<1000$, we have five choices for $k$, namely $k=0,2,4,6,8$.\nIf $k=0$, then $n+1$ is odd, so $k+n-1$ is odd, hence the largest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ has an odd exponent, so $S_n$ is not a perfect square.\nIn the other cases, note that $k+n-1$ is even, so the highest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ will be a perfect square. In particular, $S_n$ will be a perfect square if and only if $(n+1)/2^{k}$ is an odd perfect square.\nIf $k=2$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{4} \\le 250$, so we have $n+1 = 4, 4 \\cdot 3^2, \\ldots, 4 \\cdot 13^2, 4\\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2$.\nIf $k=4$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{16} \\le 62$, so $n+1 = 16, 16 \\cdot 3^2, 16 \\cdot 5^2, 16 \\cdot 7^2$.\nIf $k=6$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{64}\\le 15$, so $n+1=64,64\\cdot 3^2$.\nIf $k=8$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{256}\\le 3$, so $n+1=256$.\nComparing the largest term in each case, we find that the maximum possible $n$ such that $S_n$ is a perfect square is $4\\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 - 1 = \\boxed{899}$.

  "A number in decimal notation ends in a zero for each power of ten which divides it. Thus, we need to count both the number of 5s and the number of 2s dividing into our given expression.

And so on. This gives us an initial count of $96 + 91 + 86 + \\ldots + 1$. Summing this arithmetic series of $20$ terms, we get $970$. However, we have neglected some powers of $5$ - every $n!$ term for $n\\geq25$ has an additional power of $5$ dividing it, for $76$ extra; every n! for $n\\geq 50$ has one more in addition to that, for a total of $51$ extra; and similarly there are $26$ extra from those larger than $75$ and $1$ extra from $100$.

Now, let $a=2^x$ and $r=2^y$:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}(2^x)^2\\cdot(2^y)^{11}&=&2^{1003}\\\\ 2^{2x}\\cdot 2^{11y}&=&2^{1003}\\\\ 2x+11y&=&1003\\\\ y&=&\\frac{1003-2x}{11} \\end{eqnarray*}\nFor $y$ to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by $11$. This occurs when $x=1$ because $1001=91*11$. Because only even integers are being subtracted from $1003$, the numerator never equals an even multiple of $11$. Therefore, the numerator takes on the value of every odd multiple of $11$ from $11$ to $1001$. Since the odd multiples are separated by a distance of $22$, the number of ordered pairs that work is $1 + \\frac{1001-11}{22}=1 + \\frac{990}{22}=46$.

Thus, $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(9x + k)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x + \\left[\\frac{5}{9}k\\right]) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5} \\left[\\frac{5}{9}k \\right] \\right] + 9x + 32$. We need to find all values $0 \\le k \\le 8$ that $\\left[ \\frac{9}{5} \\left[ \\frac{5}{9} k \\right] \\right] = k$. Testing every value of $k$ shows that $k = 0, 2, 4, 5, 7$, so $5$ of every $9$ values of $k$ work.\nThere are $\\lfloor \\frac{1000 - 32}{9} \\rfloor = 107$ cycles of $9$, giving $5 \\cdot 107 = 535$ numbers that work. Of the remaining $6$ numbers from $995$ onwards, $995,\\ 997,\\ 999,\\ 1000$ work, giving us $535 + 4 = \\boxed{539}$ as the solution. The answer is 539.",

  "Let $n$ be the number of car lengths that separates each car. Then their speed is at most $15n$. Let a unit be the distance between the cars (front to front). Then the length of each unit is $4(n + 1)$. To maximize, in a unit, the CAR comes first, THEN the empty space. So at time zero, the car is right at the eye.\nHence, we count the number of units that pass the eye in an hour: $\\frac {15,000n\\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{hour}}}{4(n + 1)\\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{unit}}} = \\frac {15,000n}{4(n + 1)}\\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}}$. We wish to maximize this.\nObserve that as $n$ gets larger, the $+ 1$ gets less and less significant, so we take the limit as $n$ approaches infinity\n$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac {15,000n}{4(n + 1)} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac {15,000}{4} = 3750$\nNow, as the speeds are clearly finite, we can never actually reach $3750$ full UNITs. However, we only need to find the number of CARS. We can increase their speed so that the camera stops (one hour goes by) after the car part of the $3750$th unit has passed, but not all of the space behind it. Hence, $3750$ cars is possible, and the answer is $\\boxed{375}$. The answer is 375.",

Thus, $(j,s) = (13,1),(8,5),(3,9)$.\n$(13,1)$ and $(3,9)$ give non-integral $b$, but $(8,5)$ gives $b = 15$. Thus, our answer is $15^{2} + 8^{2} + 5^{2} = \\boxed{314}$. The answer is 314.",
  "Let the $k$th number in the $n$th row be $a(n,k)$. Writing out some numbers, we find that $a(n,k) = 2^{n-1}(n+2k-2)$.[1]\nWe wish to find all $(n,k)$ such that $67| a(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n+2k-2)$. Since $2^{n-1}$ and $67$ are relatively prime, it follows that $67|n+2k-2$. Since every row has one less element than the previous row, $1 \\le k \\le 51-n$ (the first row has $50$ elements, the second $49$, and so forth; so $k$ can range from $1$ to $50$ in the first row, and so forth). Hence\n$n+2k-2 \\le n + 2(51-n) - 2 = 100 - n \\le 100,$\nit follows that $67| n - 2k + 2$ implies that $n-2k+2 = 67$ itself.\nNow, note that we need $n$ to be odd, and also that $n+2k-2 = 67 \\le 100-n \\Longrightarrow n \\le 33$.\nWe can check that all rows with odd $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 33$ indeed contains one entry that is a multiple of $67$, and so the answer is $\\frac{33+1}{2} = \\boxed{17}$.

  "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square.

The last doesn't work, obviously. This gives the three solutions $(a,b,c) = (5,2,3),(3,5,2),(1,8,1)$.

  "Write $n^2 = (m + 1)^3 - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1$, or equivalently, $(2n + 1)(2n - 1) = 4n^2 - 1 = 12m^2 + 12m + 3 = 3(2m + 1)^2$.\nSince $2n + 1$ and $2n - 1$ are both odd and their difference is $2$, they are relatively prime. But since their product is three times a square, one of them must be a square and the other three times a square. We cannot have $2n - 1$ be three times a square, for then $2n + 1$ would be a square congruent to $2$ modulo $3$, which is impossible.\nThus $2n - 1$ is a square, say $b^2$. But $2n + 79$ is also a square, say $a^2$. Then $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 = 80$. Since $a + b$ and $a - b$ have the same parity and their product is even, they are both even. To maximize $n$, it suffices to maximize $2b = (a + b) - (a - b)$ and check that this yields an integral value for $m$. This occurs when $a + b = 40$ and $a - b = 2$, that is, when $a = 21$ and $b = 19$. This yields $n = 181$ and $m = 104$, so the answer is $\\boxed{181}$. The answer is 181.",

When $k = 2$, the number is $964$. When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct. By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$.

  "First, note that $(2n)!! = 2^n \\cdot n!$, and that $(2n)!! \\cdot (2n-1)!! = (2n)!$.\nWe can now take the fraction $\\dfrac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$ and multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $(2i)!!$. We get that this fraction is equal to $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(2i)!!^2} = \\dfrac{(2i)!}{2^{2i}(i!)^2}$.\nNow we can recognize that $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(i!)^2}$ is simply ${2i \\choose i}$, hence this fraction is $\\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$, and our sum turns into $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{2009} \\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$.\nLet $c = \\sum_{i=1}^{2009} {2i\\choose i} \\cdot 2^{2\\cdot 2009 - 2i}$. Obviously $c$ is an integer, and $S$ can be written as $\\dfrac{c}{2^{2\\cdot 2009}}$. Hence if $S$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, its denominator will be of the form $2^a$ for some $a\\leq 2\\cdot 2009$.\nIn other words, we just showed that $b=1$. To determine $a$, we need to determine the largest power of $2$ that divides $c$.\nLet $p(i)$ be the largest $x$ such that $2^x$ that divides $i$.\nWe can now return to the observation that $(2i)! = (2i)!! \\cdot (2i-1)!! = 2^i \\cdot i! \\cdot (2i-1)!!$. Together with the obvious fact that $(2i-1)!!$ is odd, we get that $p((2i)!)=p(i!)+i$.\nIt immediately follows that $p\\left( {2i\\choose i} \\right) = p((2i)!) - 2p(i!) = i - p(i!)$, and hence $p\\left( {2i\\choose i} \\cdot 2^{2\\cdot 2009 - 2i} \\right) = 2\\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$.\nObviously, for $i\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,2009\\}$ the function $f(i)=2\\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$ is is a strictly decreasing function. Therefore $p(c) = p\\left( {2\\cdot 2009\\choose 2009} \\right) = 2009 - p(2009!)$.\nWe can now compute $p(2009!) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{2009}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor = 1004 + 502 + \\cdots + 3 + 1 = 2001$. Hence $p(c)=2009-2001=8$.\nAnd thus we have $a=2\\cdot 2009 - p(c) = 4010$, and the answer is $\\dfrac{ab}{10} = \\dfrac{4010\\cdot 1}{10} = \\boxed{401}$. The answer is 401.",

Without loss of generality, we place $3$ in $A$. Then $9$ must be placed in $B$, so $81$ must be placed in $A$, and $27$ must be placed in $B$.

  "Note that $x \\equiv y \\pmod{1000} \\Leftrightarrow x \\equiv y \\pmod{125}$ and $x \\equiv y \\pmod{8}$.

  "We see that a number $n$ is $p$-safe if and only if the residue of $n \\mod p$ is greater than $2$ and less than $p-2$; thus, there are $p-5$ residues $\\mod p$ that a $p$-safe number can have. Therefore, a number $n$ satisfying the conditions of the problem can have $2$ different residues $\\mod 7$, $6$ different residues $\\mod 11$, and $8$ different residues $\\mod 13$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that for a number $x$ that is $a$ (mod b) $c$ (mod d) $e$ (mod f) has one solution if $gcd(b,d,f)=1$. For example, in our case, the number $n$ can be: 3 (mod 7) 3 (mod 11) 7 (mod 13) so since $gcd(7,11,13)$=1, there is 1 solution for n for this case of residues of $n$.\nThis means that by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $n$ can have $2\\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = 96$ different residues mod $7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 1001$. Thus, there are $960$ values of $n$ satisfying the conditions in the range $0 \\le n < 10010$. However, we must now remove any values greater than $10000$ that satisfy the conditions.

  "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$.

Also, $221=13*17.$ Now finally we simplify and get:\n$c \\equiv 7 \\mod 221$\nBut we know $c$ is between $0$ and $9$ because it is a digit, so $c$ must be $7.$ Now it is straightforward from here to find $a$ and $b$:\n$2210a+221b+11(7)=9801 \\iff 221(10a+b)=9724 \\iff 10a+b=44$\nand since a and b are both between $0$ and $9$, we have $a=b=4$.

Factor this into $2^{20} \\cdot 5^{20}$, and add the two 20's, resulting in $m$, which is $40$. Add $m$ to $2m + 2n$ (which is $840$) to get $40+840 = \\boxed{880}$. The answer is 880.",

If we use any $5$ cent stamps when forming $96$, we could simply remove one to get $91$. This means that we must obtain the value $96$ using only stamps of denominations $n$ and $n+1$.\nRecalling that $n \\geq 24$, we can easily figure out the working $(n,n+1)$ pairs that can used to obtain $96$, as we can use at most $\\frac{96}{24}=4$ stamps without going over.

As $(a+1)(b+1)$ must be a divisor of 20, there are not many cases to check.\nIf $a+1 = 4$, then $b+1 = 5$. But this leads to no solutions, as $(a,b) = (3,4)$ gives $2^3 5^4 > 2019$.\nIf $a+1 = 5$, then $b+1 = 2$ or $4$. The first case gives $n = 2^4 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot p$ where $p$ is a prime other than 2 or 5. Thus we have $80p < 2019 \\implies p = 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$.

  "Since prime factorizing $323$ gives you $17 \\cdot 19$, the desired answer needs to be a multiple of $17$ or $19$, this is because if it is not a multiple of $17$ or $19$, $n$ will be more than a $4$ digit number. For example, if the answer were to instead be $324$, $n$ would have to be a multiple of $2^2 * 3^4 * 17 * 19$ for both $323$ and $324$ to be a valid factor, meaning $n$ would have to be at least $104652$, which is too big.

  "Let us simplify the problem. Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$. Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer.\nFrom this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$. We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$. Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$.\nThe average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$. The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$. We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$. There are four possibilities: $28$, $35$, $42$, $49$. However, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$) must be a multiple of $6$ as well. Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to $30$.)\nThus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$. We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of $5$. The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$. Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$, the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$. However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation. Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$. Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$. Our final answer is $10+90=  \\boxed{100}$. The answer is 100.",

  "Obviously, $1$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod 7$ (its powers are all congruent to $1$!).\n\nExamining the powers of $2$, we see that $\\{2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\} \\equiv \\{2,4,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ with repetition from this point onward. Since the powers of $2$ do not include all residues from $1$ to $6\\pmod 7$, we see that $2$ is not a primitive root.\n\nThe logic of this example can be generalized. If $a$ is an integer and $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$, then the powers of $a$ repeat on a cycle of length at most $k$. Therefore, for $a$ to be a primitive root, it is necessary that $a^k\\not\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for all positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$. Conversely, if $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for some positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$, then $a$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod p$.

We find that 3874 divided by 23 gives a remainder of 10, 481 divided by 23 gives a remainder of 21, and 1205 gives a remainder of 9. So the given congruence is equivalent to  $$\n10x + 21 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{23}.\n$$Now add 2 to both sides to obtain $$\n10x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{23}.\n$$Notice that we have replaced 23 with 0 on the left-hand side, since $23\\equiv 0\\pmod{23}$. Now let us find the modular inverse of 10. We want to find an integer which is divisible by 10 and one more than a multiple of 23. Note that since the units digit of 23 is 3, the units digit of $3\\times 23$ is 9, so $3\\times 23+1$ is a multiple of 10.  Thus $(3\\times23+1)/10=7$ is the modular inverse of 10. Multiplying both sides of $10x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{23}$ by 7 gives $x\\equiv 77 \\pmod{23}$, which implies $x\\equiv 8\\pmod{23} $.

Thus $28-1=\\boxed{27}$ is the modular inverse of 27 (mod 28). (Note that since $(m-1)^2=m^2-2m+1\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, we always have that $m-1$ is its own inverse modulo $m$.) The answer is 27.",

However, since $a_k$ is nonzero, $9^{k+1}$ does not divide $10!$. Therefore, we need to find the highest power of $9$ that divides $10!$ without remainder. We can prime factorize $10!$ by prime factorizing each integer between 2 and 10. The exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of $10!$ is 4, since 3 and 6 each contribute one factor of 3 while 9 contributes two. Therefore, $9^2$ divides $10!$ while $9^3$ does not.

  "When summing these three numbers, we notice that $5 + 4 + 1$ leaves a residue of $1$ when divided by $9$, so it follows that the sum has a rightmost digit of $1$ and that carry-over must occur. After carrying over to the next digit, we must find the sum of $1 + 7 + 1 + 6 = 16_9$, which leaves a residue of $6$ when divided by $9$. Thus, we write down $6$ as the next digit and carry-over another $1$. Evaluating the next digit, we must find the sum of $1+1+7 = 10_9$, which leaves a residue of $0$ when divided by $9$.

It follows that $S + B + A$ leaves a residue of $S$ upon division by $d$. Thus, $B+A$ must be divisible by $d$. Since $B$ and $A$ cannot both be $0$, and $B+A < (d-1) + (d-1) = 2d-2$, then $B + A = d$.\n\nLooking at the $d$s digit, we must carry-over $1$ from the units digit sum, so $1 + A + B + E \\equiv S \\pmod{d}$. Since $B + A = d$, then $1 + E + d \\equiv 1+E \\equiv S \\pmod{d}$. Thus, $S = E+1$ or $E = d-1$ and $S = 0$. However, the latter is impossible since $S$ is the leftmost digit of 'SEAS' and 'SEA'. Thus, $S = E+1$, and we again carry-over $1$ to the $d^2$ digit.\n\nLooking at the $d^2$ digit, after carry-over, it follows that $1 + E + E + S \\equiv A \\pmod{d}$. Note that $1 + E + E + S < 1 + 3(d-1) = 3d - 2 < 3d$. Then, $2E + S + 1 - A$ is either equal to $0$, $d$, or $2d$. However, we can immediately discard the $0$ case: there would be no carry-over for the leftmost digit, so $S = B$ are not distinct.\n\nIn the next case, if $2E + S + 1 = A + d$, then there is a carry-over of $1$ to the last digit. It follows that $S + 1 = B$. This gives us the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nB + A &= d \\\\\nE + 1 &= S \\\\\nS + 1 &= B \\\\\n2E + S +1 - A&= d\n\\end{align*} Setting the first and fourth equations equal to each other yields that $d = B+A = 2E + S +1 - A$, and since $B = S+1 = E+2$, substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $2A = 3E + S + 1 - B = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - (E+2) = 2E$. This contradicts the distinct digits criterion.\n\nThus, $2E + S + 1 - A= 2d = 2(B+A)$, so $2E + S + 1 - 2B = 3A$. Also, we have that $B = S+2$, due to the carry-over in the leftmost digit. Substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $3A = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - 2(E + 3) = E - 4$, so $E = 3A+4$. Thus, $S = 3A+5$ and $B=3A+7$. Also, $S,E,$ and $A$ are decimal digits, so it follows that $S = 3A + 5 \\le 9 \\Longrightarrow A = 0,1$. We can discard the solution $A = 0$, as $d = B+A$ but $B < d$. Thus, $B = 10, S = 8, E = 7$, occurring in base $d = B+A = 11$. The answer is $\\boxed{871}$. The answer is 871.",
