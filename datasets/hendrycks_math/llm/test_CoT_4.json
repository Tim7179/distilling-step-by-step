  "There are many ways to solve this problem, the most obvious being to list all of the proper divisors and add them up. There is, however, a creative solution that uses the fact that the sum of the proper divisors of 18 is 21. Note that we can factor 198 into $11\\cdot 18=11\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 3$. Each proper divisor will be composed of three or fewer of these factors. Those divisors that do not contain the factor 11 will be either the proper divisors of 18 or 18 itself, contributing 21 and 18, respectively, to the sum. Those divisors that do contain the factor 11 will again by the proper divisors of 18, only multiplied by 11. The sum of these divisors, therefore, is $11\\cdot 21=231$. Since these are all possible divisors, the sum of the proper divisors of 198 is $21+18+231=\\boxed{270}$. The answer is 270.",

  "First, we observe that the only pairs of integers from 1 to 6 that fail to be relatively prime are any pair of even integers as well as the pair (3, 6). If we temporarily ignore the pair (3, 6), we can focus only on parity. We must arrange the six digits in such a way that no two even digits are consecutive. Using $\\color{blue}e$ to denote even and $o$ to denote odd, this gives us four different possible arrangements:\n\n\\begin{align}\n{\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} o \\\\\no {\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} \\\\\n{\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} o o {\\color{blue}e} \\\\\n{\\color{blue}e} o o {\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e\n}\\end{align}For any of these four arrangements, there are $3!$ ways to select the three even numbers and $3!$ ways to select the three odd numbers, for a total of $3! \\cdot 3! = 36$ total arrangements. Hence, ignoring the issue of (3, 6) adjacencies, we have $36 \\cdot 4 = 144$ such numbers.\n\nNow, we must count the number of the above arrangements that include any (3, 6) adjacencies and subtract them off. Let's consider the number of (3, 6) adjacencies in arrangement $(1)$. Suppose that the first digit is 6. Then if the second digit is 3, there are $2! \\cdot 2! = 4$ arrangements of the remaining digits. So there are 4 arrangements that go 6 3 \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_. If instead the third digit is 6, then by similar reasoning, there are 4 arrangements that go \\_ 3 6 \\_ \\_ \\_, and 4 arrangements that go \\_ \\_ 6 3 \\_ \\_, for a total of 8 arrangements. By symmetry, there are also 8 arrangements that include a (3, 6) adjacency when the fifth digit is 6. So, there are a total of $4 + 8 + 8 = 20$ arrangements of $(1)$ that have 3 and 6 adjacent. By symmetry, there are also $20$ arrangements of $(2)$ that have 3 and 6 adjacent.\n\nFinally, we must count the number of arrangements of $(3)$ that have 3 and 6 adjacent. From previous reasoning, we see that if the 6 is on an endpoint, there are 4 arrangements with an adjacent 3, and if 6 is in the interior, there are 8 such arrangements. Hence, in this case, there are $4 + 8 + 4 = 16$ arrangements that have 3 and 6 adjacent. Again, by symmetry, there are also $16$ arrangements of $(4)$ with 3 and 6 adjacent.\n\nOverall, there are $20 + 20 + 16 + 16 = 72$ arrangements that have 3 and 6 adjacent.

Then the sum of the divisors of $m$ is $1 + p + p^2 + p^3.$ For $p = 11,$ this value of $m$ is too low, and for $p = 13,$ the value of $m$ is too high; therefore, no prime $p$ gives a value of $n$ in the given set.\n\nTherefore, we must have $m = p \\cdot q$, for some distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ Then the sum of the divisors of $m$ is $1 + p + q + pq$, which we can factor as $(1+p)(1+q)$. First suppose that one of $p$ and $q$ equals $2$; without loss of generality, let $p = 2$. Then $(1+p)(1+q) = 3(1+q).$ Since $q \\neq p = 2$, we see that $q$ is odd, and so $1+q$ is even. Thus $3(1+q)$ is divisible by $6,$ so it must be either $2010$ or $2016.$ Trying both cases, we see that both $3(1+q) = 2010$ and $3(1 + q) = 2016$ give a non-prime value of $q.$\n\nIf neither $p$ nor $q$ equals $2$, then both are odd primes, so $(1+p)(1+q)$ is the product of two even numbers, which must be divisible by $4.$ The only multiples of $4$ in the given range are $2012$ and $2016$.

  "To express 87 in base 2, first note that $2^6=64$ is the largest power of 2 which is less than 87. Therefore, the first non-zero digit goes in the 7th place to the left of the decimal point. Since $2^4=16$ is the highest power of 2 less than $87-64=23$, the next non-zero digit goes in the 5th place to the left of the decimal point.  Continuing this process, we find $87 = 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^2 +2^1 + 2^0$, so $87_{10}=1010111_2$.  Similarly, we find $87=3^4+2\\cdot 3^1$ so $87_{10}=10020_3$.

  "We can factor $\\frac{1}{x^2+x} = \\frac{1}{x(x+1)}$. Therefore, we want both $x$ and $x+1$ to be divisible by 2 and 5. They cannot both be even, so we have that either $x$ or $x+1$ is odd, so either $x$ or $x+1$ is a power of 5. We start by considering the power $5^0 = 1$.

  "Call Jan's number $J$. $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$ and $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$, so $J$ has at least two factors of 2, one factor of 3, and one factor of 5 in its prime factorization. If $J$ has exactly two factors of 2, then the prime factorization of $J$ is of the form $2^2 \\cdot 3^a \\cdot 5^b \\cdots$. Counting the number of positive factors of this yields $(2+1)(a+1)(b+1)\\cdots = 3k$, where $k$ is some integer.

  "To find the base $5$ representation of $123_{10}$, we first write $123$ as the sum of powers of $5$. The largest power of $5$ that is less than $123$ is $5^2 = 25$ and the largest multiple of $25$ that is less than $123$ is $4 \\cdot 25 = 100$. Thus, we have $123 = 4 \\cdot 25 + 23$.

The sum of the digits of $-11213141$ is 14.  Since $-11213141$ is negative, this number is 5 $\\textit{less than}$ a multiple of 9.  The number is 4 $\\textit{more than}$ a multiple of 9.  Subtracting 4 gives  \\[-11213141 = -11213145+4.\\]Since $-11213145$ has a digit sum of 18, this number is a multiple of 9.

  "If $a$ is not relatively prime with $24$, then the modular inverse of $a$ does not exist. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by $a$ yields that $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}$, or equivalently that $a^2 - 1 \\equiv (a+1)(a-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$. Since $a$ is not divisible by $3$, it follows that at least one of $a+1$ or $a-1$ must be divisible by $3$. Also, since $a$ is not divisible by $2$, then both $a+1$ and $a-1$ are even, and exactly one of them is divisible by $4$. Thus, $3 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 24$ will always divide into $(a+1)(a-1)$, and so the statement is true for every integer $a$ relatively prime to $24$. The answer is the set of numbers relatively prime to $24$, namely $\\{1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23\\}$. There are $\\boxed{8}$ such numbers.\n\nThe number of positive integers smaller than and relatively prime to $24$ is also given by the Euler's totient function. The answer is 8.",
  "Let $p$ and $q$ be the prime divisors of $n$, so we can write $n = p^a \\cdot q^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.

  "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.  The smallest of these is $\\boxed{60}$.

  "Because $3^6=729<2007<2187=3^7$, it is convenient to begin by counting the number of base-3 palindromes with at most 7 digits. There are two palindromes of length 1, namely 1 and 2.  There are also two palindromes of length 2, namely 11 and 22.  For $n\\geq 1$, each palindrome of length $2n+1$ is obtained by inserting one of the digits $0$, $1$,  or $2$ immediately after the $n\\text{th}$ digit in a palindrome of length $2n$.  Each palindrome of length $2n+2$ is obtained by similarly inserting one of the strings $00$, $11$,  or $22$.  Therefore there are 6 palindromes of each of the lengths 3 and 4, 18 of each of the lengths 5 and 6, and 54 of length 7. Because the base-3 representation of 2007 is 2202100, that integer is less than each of the palindromes 2210122, 2211122, 2212122, 2220222, 2221222, and 2222222.

There are $12$ multiples of $9$ less than $109$, and we need to add one to our exponent for each of these. That gives another $12$ to the exponent.\n\nSome numbers are also multiples of $3^3=27$. (Horrible, isn't it?) We actually have four such numbers: $27$, $54$, $81$, and $108$.

  "From each vertex $V$, we can draw 3 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 6 vertices in a hexagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $6\\times 3 = 18$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\\frac{18}{2} = \\boxed{9}$ distinct diagonals in a convex hexagon. The answer is 9.",

  "The diagonals of a rhombus divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles, the legs of which are half-diagonals of the rhombus.  Let $a$ and $b$ be the half-diagonal lengths of the rhombus.  The area of the rhombus is 4 times the area of one of the right triangles, in other words $4\\times\\frac{1}{2}ab=2ab$.  Since $a=5$ units and the area of the rhombus is $120$ square units, we find $b=120/(2\\cdot5)=12$ units.

  "You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $42!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n\nEvery time a number is a multiple of $5$, it adds a factor of $5$ to the prime factorization. There are $8$ multiples of $5$ between $1$ and $42$. Now look at $25$. It actually has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them, so now we need to count one more. This gives a total of $8+1=9$ times the factor $5$ appears, so $42!$ has $\\boxed{9}$ zeroes at the end. The answer is 9.",

  "A pot will have 3 different colored balloons on it if it is a multiple of 4, 6, and 10. Thus, we must first find the LCM of 4, 6, and 10. $4=2^2$, $6=2\\cdot3$, and $10=2\\cdot5$. For a number to be a multiple of all three of these numbers, it prime factorization must have a 2 raised to at least the second power, a 3 raised to at least the first power, and a 5 raised to at least the first power.
