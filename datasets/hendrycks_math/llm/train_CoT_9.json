  "The discriminant of the given quadratic equation is $\\left(b+\\frac 1b\\right)^2 - 4c$. For the quadratic to have one root, it follows that the discriminant must be equal to zero, so $b^2 + 2 - 4c + \\frac 1{b^2} = 0$.

Multiplying through by $b^2$ (for we know that $b \\neq 0$) yields that $b^4 + (2-4c)b^2 + 1 = 0$; this is a quadratic equation in $b^2$ that has discriminant $(2-4c)^2 - 4$.

  "In the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots sum to $\\frac{-b}{a}$ and multiply to $\\frac{c}{a}$. Therefore, for $x^2-nx+m$, we know that the sum of the roots is $n$ and the product of the roots is $m$. The requirement that $n$ be an integer with $0<n<100$ along with the requirement that the roots are consecutive positive integers leaves us with 49 possible values of $n$: $(1+2), (2+3), (3+4),...,(48+49),(49+50)$. Of these values of $n$, the corresponding value of $m$ would be $(1\\ast2), (2\\ast3), (3\\ast4),...,(48\\ast49), (49\\ast50)$. In order for $m$ to be divisible by 3, thus, one of the roots has to be divisible by three. The values of $n$ in $(2+3), (3+4), (5+6), ... ,(48+49)$ satisfy that requirement, but in $(1+2), (4+5), ... ,(49+50)$ they do not. This eliminates one third of the possibilities for $n$. Since $n=(49+50)$ is disqualified, we are left with $48-(48\\div 3) = 48-16=\\boxed{32}$ possible values of $n$. The answer is 32.",

  "Consider the expression $P(a) = (a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$ as a polynomial in $a$. It follows that $P(-b) = (b -b + c)^3 - (-b)^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 0$, so $a+b$ is a factor of the polynomial $P(a)$. By symmetry, $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$ divides into the expression $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$; as both expressions are of degree $3$ in their variables, it follows that $$(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = k(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 150 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5,$$ where we can determine that $k = 3$ by examining what the expansion of $(a+b+c)^3$ will look like.

  "We start by finding the inverse function of $f$. By definition, we know that $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$, so $$\\frac{f^{-1}(x)-3}{f^{-1}(x)-4} = x.$$We can solve this equation for $f^{-1}(x)$. First we multiply both sides by $f^{-1}(x)-4$: $$f^{-1}(x)-3 = x\\cdot(f^{-1}(x)-4).$$Then we expand: $$f^{-1}(x)-3 = x\\cdot f^{-1}(x)-4x.$$Then we rearrange so as to group all terms involving $f^{-1}(x)$ on the left side: $$f^{-1}(x)-x\\cdot f^{-1}(x) = 3-4x.$$We can factor on the left side: $$f^{-1}(x)\\cdot (1-x) = 3-4x.$$Finally, we divide both sides by $1-x$ to obtain our inverse function, $$f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{3-4x}{1-x}.$$This function is defined for all $x$ except $\\boxed{1}$.

  "There are $n+1$ terms in the sequence $x, x+2, x+4, \\ldots, x+2n$, and either all of them are even or all of them are odd.  If they were all even, then their cubes would be even and the sum of their cubes would be even.  Therefore, all the terms are odd.\n\nIf the sequence contains both positive and negative terms, then it contains more negative terms than positive terms, since the sum of the cubes of the terms is $-1197$.  Also, all of the positive terms will be additive opposites of the first several negative terms, so we may first look for consecutive negative odd numbers whose cubes sum to $-1197$.  If we add cubes until we pass $-1197$, we find that  \\[\n(-1)^3+(-3)^3+(-5)^3+(-7)^3+(-9)^3=-1225.\n\\] Since 1197 is 28 less than 1225, we would like to drop two terms than sum to $-28$.

For example, setting $x = -5$, we get $45G = 45$, so $G = 1$.  Setting $x = 0$, we get $5H = 10$, so $H = 2$.  (This may not seem legitimate, because we are told that the given equation holds for all $x$ except $-5$, 0, and 4.  This tells us that the equation $Gx(x - 4) + H(x + 5) = x^2 - 2x + 10$ holds for all $x$, except possibly $-5$, 0, and 4.  However, both sides of this equation are polynomials, and if two polynomials are equal for an infinite number of values of $x$, then the two polynomials are equal for all values of $x$.

  "Multiplying out that entire polynomial would be pretty ugly, so let's see if there's a faster way. The degree of $(2x^4+3x^3+x-14)(3x^{10}-9x^7+9x^4+30)$ is the highest possible power of $x$, which occurs when we multiply $(2x^4)(3x^{10})$. This gives $6x^{14}$ so the degree of the first part is $14$. To find the degree of $(x^2+5)^7$, we need to find the highest possible power of $x$. This product is equivalent to multiplying $(x^2+5)$ by itself $7$ times, and each term is created by choosing either $x^2$ or $5$ from each of the seven factors. To get the largest power of $x$, we should choose $x^2$ from all seven factors, to find $(x^2)^7=x^{14}$ as the highest power of $x$, so the second part is also a degree-$14$ polynomial. Thus we have a degree-$14$ polynomial minus a degree-$14$ polynomial, which will give us another degree-$14$ polynomial... unless the $x^{14}$ terms cancel out. We must check this. In the first part, the coefficient on $x^{14}$ was $6$, and in the second part the coefficient was $1$. So our expression will look like $(6x^{14}+\\ldots)-(x^{14}+\\ldots)$ where all the other terms have degree less than $14$, so when simplified the expression will be $5x^{14}+\\ldots$. Thus the coefficient on the $x^{14}$ term is not zero, and the polynomial has degree $\\boxed{14}$. The answer is 14.",

The expression on the left end of this inequality chain must therefore be greater than or equal to the $6+s/2$ on the right, so \\[2s \\ge 6 + s/2 \\implies 3s/2 \\ge 6 \\implies s\\ge \\boxed{4}.\\] The answer is 4.",
  "The line $x=k$ intersects $y=x^2+6x+5$ at the point $(k, k^2+6k+5)$ and the line $y=mx+b$ at the point $(k,mk+b)$. Since these two points have the same $x$-coordinate, the distance between them is the difference of their $y$-coordinates, so we have $$|(k^2+6k+5)-(mk+b)|=5.$$ Simplifying, this gives us two quadratic equations: $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=5$ and $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=-5$. We can express these as  \\begin{align*}\nk^2+(6-m)k-b=0&\\quad(1)\\\\\nk^2+(6-m)k+10-b=0.&\\quad(2)\n\\end{align*} We know that all solutions to both of these equations will be places where the line $y=mx+b$ is a vertical distance of $5$ from the parabola, but we know there can only be one such solution! Thus there must be exactly $1$ solution to one of the equations, and no solutions to the other equation. We find the discriminants ($b^2-4ac$) of the equations, so for equation $(1)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(-b)=(6-m)^2+4b$. For equation $(2)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(10-b)=(6-m)^2+4b-40$. One of these equations must equal zero, and one must be less than zero. Since $-40<0$, adding $(6-m)^2+4b$ to both sides doesn't change the inequality and $(6-m)^2+4b-40<(6-m)^2+4b$, so the greater value must be equal to zero so that the lesser value is always less than zero. Thus we have $(6-m)^2+4b=0$.\n\nWe are also given that the line $y=mx+b$ passes through the point $(1,6)$, so substituting $x=1$ and $y=6$ gives $6=(1)m+b$ or $m+b=6$. This means that $6-m=b$, so we can substitute in the above equation: \\begin{align*}\n(6-m)^2+4b&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(b)^2+4b&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb(b+4)&=0.\n\\end{align*} We are given that $b\\neq 0$, so the only solution is $b=-4$. When we plug this into the equation $m+b=6$, we find $m-4=6$ so $m=10$. Thus the equation of the line is $y=mx+b$ or $\\boxed{y=10x-4}$. The answer is y=10x-4.",
