  "The total cost of the peanut butter and jam is $N(4B+5J) = 253$ cents, so $N$ and $4B + 5J$ are factors of $253 =\n11\\cdot23$. Because $N>1$, the possible values of $N$ are 11, 23, and 253. If $N=253$, then $4B+5J = 1$, which is impossible since $B$ and $J$ are positive integers. If $N=23$, then $4B + 5J = 11$, which also has no solutions in positive integers. Hence $N = 11$ and $4B+5J=23$, which has the unique positive integer solution $B=2$ and $J=3$. So the cost of the jam is $11(3)(5\\text{ cents})=\\boxed{\\$1.65}$. The answer is \\$1.65.",

The graph of this equation is a parabola with $x$-intercepts $(0,0)$ and $(15,0)$.  The axis of symmetry is mid-way between these intercepts, so it is at $x=7.5$, which means the vertex is on the line $x=7.5$.  The parabola goes downward from the vertex both to the left and right, so the highest possible point on the graph that has an integer coordinate for $x$ must have $x=7$ or $x=8$ as the $x$-coordinate.

  "The pattern suggests that for a number with $n$ nines, that number squared has $n-1$ zeros. Thus, $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$ should have $8-1=7$ zeros.

Furthermore, any three adjacent faces must contain one of $a$ or $d$. Therefore, every term contains $a$ or $d$, and the expression is symmetric in $a$ and $d$. Considering the expression as a polynomial in $a$ (with the remaining variables fixed), we observe that $P(-d)=0$. Therefore, $a+d$ divides the given expression. Similarly, $b+e$ and $c+f$ divide the given expression as well. Therefore, $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def = k(a+d)(b+e)(c+f).$$ Here, since both sides are of degree three in their variables, $k$ must be a constant, which is easily seen to be $1$.\n\nIt follows that $(a+d)(b+e)(c+f) = 1001 = 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.

  "Consider the numbers $1, 2, 3,..., 10$. Jo would add these integers up as is, while Kate would round the first four down to 0, decreasing her sum by $1+2+3+4=10$, and would round the last six up to 10, increasing her sum by $5+4+3+2+1+0=15$. Thus, her sum is $-10+15=5$ more than Jo's sum for the numbers $1, 2, 3,..., 10$. This same logic applies to the numbers $11, 12, 13,..., 20$ also, and in general it applies to every ten numbers greater than 20. Since there are ten sets of ten numbers from 1 to 100, Kate's sum is $10 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{50}$ more than Jo's sum. The answer is 50.",
  "Because the point for which we are looking is on the $x$-axis, we know that it is of the form $(x, 0)$. We apply the distance formula. The distance from A is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(-2-x)^2+(0-0)^2} &= \\sqrt{x^2+4x+4}\n\\end{align*} The distance from B is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(0-x)^2 + (4-0)^2} &= \\sqrt{x^2+16}\n\\end{align*} Because the point is equidistant from A and B, we set the two distances equal: $x^2+4x+4 = x^2 + 16$. Simplifying gives us $4x = 12$, or $x = \\boxed{3}$. The answer is 3.",
  "Distributing the exponent and using the power of a power law, we have $(2x^3)^3=(2^3)((x^{3})^3)=8(x^{3\\ast3})=\\boxed{8x^9}$. The answer is 8x^9.",
  "Let's denote the first term as $a$ and the common ratio as $r.$ Additionally, call the original sum of the series $S.$ It follows that \\[\\frac{a}{1-r}=S.\\] After the first three terms of the sequence are removed, the new leading term is $ar^3.$ Then one $27^{\\text{th}}$ of the original series is equivalent to \\[\\frac{ar^3}{1-r}=r^3\\left( \\frac{a}{1-r}\\right)=\\frac{S}{27}.\\]\n\nDividing the second equation by the first, $r^3= \\frac{1}{27}$ and $r=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}.$ The answer is \\frac{1}{3}.",
  "Note that if the the two series have constant ratios of $a$ and $b,$ respectively, then $4\\left( \\frac{12}{1-a} \\right) = \\frac{12}{1-b}.$ Simplifying, $4(1-b)=1-a.$ Substituting in $a= \\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ and $b= \\frac{4+n}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{n}{12},$ we quickly find that $n=\\boxed{6}.$ The answer is 6.",

  "While we can solve for $a$ and $b$ individually, it is simpler to note that $f(1) = a + b$. Thus, substituting $1$ into the given equation, we obtain $$g(f(1)) = 3 \\cdot 1 + 4 = 7.$$ Thus, $$g(f(1)) = 2 \\cdot f(1) - 5 = 7 \\Longrightarrow f(1) = \\boxed{6}.$$ The answer is 6.",
  "We will complete the square to determine the standard form equation of the circle. Shifting all but the constant term from the RHS to the LHS, we have $x^2-4x+y^2-12y=-39$. Completing the square in $x$, we add $(-4/2)^2=4$ to both sides. Completing the square in $y$, we add $(-12/2)^2=36$ to both sides. The equation becomes \\begin{align*}\nx^2-4x+y^2-12y&=-39\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2-4x+4+y^2-12y+36&=1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x-2)^2+(y-6)^2&=1\n\\end{align*} Thus, the center of the circle is at point $(2,6)$ so $h+k=2+6=\\boxed{8}$.

The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 = b^2 - 16$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 16 < 0$, or $b^2 < 16$.  The set of values of $b$ that satisfy this inequality is $b \\in \\boxed{(-4,4)}$. The answer is (-4,4).",

  "Notice that the quantity $4a^2+1$ appears in various forms throughout the expression on the left-hand side. So let $4a^2+1=x$ to simplify the expression to $\\frac{7\\sqrt{x}-x}{\\sqrt{x}+3}$. This still looks messy, so let $\\sqrt{x}=y$. Our equation becomes \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{7y-y^2}{y+3}&=2.\n\\end{align*} Clearing denominators, rearranging, and factoring, we find \\begin{align*}\n7y-y^2&=2(y+3)\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n7y-y^2&=2y+6\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=y^2-5y+6\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(y-2)(y-3).\n\\end{align*} Thus $y=2$ or $y=3$, so $\\sqrt{x}=2,3$ and $x=4$ or $x=9$.

  "When $x<1$ or $x>5$, $-x^2+bx-5<0$. That means that $-x^2+bx-5=0$ at $x=1$ and $x=5$. So, the parabola has roots at 1 and 5, giving us $(x-1)(x-5)=0$. However, we also know the parabola opens downwards since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative, so we have to negate one of the factors. We can now write $-x^2+bx-5=(1-x)(x-5)=-x^2+6x-5$. Thus, $b=\\boxed{6}$. The answer is 6.",

Canceling a $2$ gives $y^2 + 9y - 36 = 0$, which factors into $(y+12)(y-3)$. Thus, $y = 3$ and $x = 12$. So, $x \\cdot y = \\boxed{36}$. The answer is 36.",

  "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=95$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 96$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=96$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $96$: $(96,1), (48,2), (32,3), (24,4), (16,6), \\text{and} (12,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 4 pairs. The pair $(16,6)$ gives us $a=15, b=5$ which doesn't work because $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, so we are left with the last pair, which gives $a=11$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{18}$.
