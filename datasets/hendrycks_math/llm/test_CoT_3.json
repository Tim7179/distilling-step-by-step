  "Let $a$ denote the length of time, in minutes, that Anna holds her breath, $b$ denote the time that Bertram holds his breath, $c$ denote the time that Carli holds her breath, and $d$ denote the time that David holds his breath. Using the information in the problem, we can form the following system of linear equations (note that $\\frac{2}{5}$ of an hour is the same as $24$ minutes):  \\begin{align*}\n3a &= b + c + d \\\\\n4b &= a + c + d \\\\\n2c &= a + b + d \\\\\n8a + 10b + 6c &= 24\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the third equation from the first gives $3a - 2c = c - a$, which simplifies to $4a = 3c$. Subtracting the third equation from the second gives $4b - 2c = c - b$, so $5b = 3c$. We thus have that $4a = 5b = 3c$. Call this value $x$. Substituting $x$ for $4a$, $5b$, and $3c$ in the fourth equation gives $6x = 24$, so $x = 4$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$, $b = \\frac{4}{5}$, and $c = \\frac{4}{3}$. Substituting these values into the first equation yields $3 = \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{4}{3} + d$, so $d = \\frac{13}{15}$.

  "We will consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: $x-3$ is nonnegative.  In this case, we have $|x-3| = x-3$.  Also, if $x-3$ is nonnegative, then $3-x$ (which is $-1$ times $x-3$) is nonpositive, which means that $|3-x| = -(3-x)$.  So, substituting for the absolute values in the original equation, we have  \\[x-3 - (3-x) -1 = 3.\\]Solving this equation gives $x = 5$.\n\nCase 2: $x-3$ is negative. In this case, we have $|x-3| = -(x-3)$.  Also, when $x-3$ is negative, then $3-x$ is positive, so $|3-x| = 3-x$.  So, substituting for the absolute values in the original equation, we have  \\[-(x-3) + 3-x - 1 = 3.\\]Solving this equation gives $x = 1$.\n\nCombining our cases, the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nNotice that we could have solved this equation even faster by noticing that $|3-x| = |(-1)(x-3)| = |(-1)||x-3| = |x-3|$, so the original equation simplifies to $2|x-3| - 1 = 3$, which gives us $|x-3| = 2$.  From here, we see that $x$ is 2 away from 3 on the number line, so $x$ is 5 or 1. The answer is 6.",

The total distance that the ball falls is therefore $$\\frac{405\\left(1-\\left(\\frac23\\right)^4\\right)}{1-\\frac23} = 975.$$Now, we calculate the total distance that the ball rises. Initially, the ball rises $405(2/3)$ meters. The next time, it rises $405(2/3)(2/3)$ meters, and so on. This time, our geometric series has a first term of $405(2/3),$ common ratio $2/3,$ and three terms. Thus, the ball rises a total of $$\\frac{405\\cdot\\frac23\\left(1-\\left(\\frac23\\right)^3\\right)}{1-\\frac23} = 570.$$Adding together these two values, we find that the ball has traveled a total of $975 + 570 = \\boxed{1545}$ meters.

  "Let $x$ be the length of the hypotenuse, and let $y$ be the length of the other leg.  Then we have $x^2-y^2=162^2$.  Factoring both sides gives $(x+y)(x-y)=(2\\times3^4)^2=2^2\\times3^8$.  A pair of positive integers $(x,y)$ gives a solution to this equation if and only if $(x+y)$ and $(x-y)$ are factors whose product is $2^2*3^8$.  For positive integers $a$ and $b$, the equations $x+y=a$ and $x-y=b$ have positive integer solutions if and only if  $a-b$ is an even positive integer.  Thus if $ab=2^2*3^8$ and the difference between $a$ and $b$ is even, then we get a valid triangle with $x+y=a$ and $x-y=b$.  Since $ab$ is even, at least one of the factors is even, and since their difference is even, the other must be as well.  Since $x+y>x-y$ we have $a>b$ i.e. $a>2\\times3^4.$  Since the prime factorization of $a$ must have exactly one $2$, the choices for $a$ that give valid triangles are $2\\times3^5,2\\times3^6,2\\times3^7,2\\times3^8.$  Thus there are $\\boxed{4}$ valid triangles.

  "If $\\frac{1}{k}$ has a terminating decimal representation, then $k$ can be written in the form $2^a5^b$ for nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$. To see this, note that by multiplying and dividing by a sufficiently large power of 10, we can write a terminating decimal as $r/10^s$ for some integers $r$ and $s$. Since the denominator's prime factorization contains only twos and fives, it may contain only twos and fives after simplification as well. Therefore, we start by listing the first several integers which are divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The first seven such values of $k$ are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 16.  Seeing that the list contains six elements preceding the large gap between 10 and 16, we guess that $2\\times 6=12$ is the least positive integer up to which half of the positive integers give terminating decimals. Checking that the proportion is above 1/2 for $n=10, 8, 6, 4,$ and $2$, we find that $\\boxed{12}$ is indeed the least integer satisfying the given condition. The answer is 12.",

  "For an integer $abcde$ to be divisible by $11$ then $a-b+c-d+e$ is divisible by $11.$\n\nWe start with the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 0.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d.$ Since we have a palindrome, we must have $a = e$ and $b = d,$ meaning that $2a+c=2b.$ We must have that $a$ and $e$ must be at least $1,$ so then we can let $b$ and $d$ also be 1 and $c$ be zero. So the smallest such five-digit palindrome is $11011.$\n\nThen, we investigate the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 11.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d+11,$ and $a = e$ and $b = d,$ so  $2a + c = 11 + 2b.$ We see that we can let $a$ be 1 and $c$ be 9, then $b = 0,$ and we have the palindrome $10901.$\n\nFinally, $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = -11.$ Then, $2a + c = 2b - 11.$ We check if $a = 1$ has any solutions.

Since, $(2\\cdot 4^4)=512<527<(3\\cdot 4^4)=768$, the digit in the $4^4$ place is $2$. We know that $527-512=15$, so there will be zeros in the $4^3$ place and $4^2$ place. The largest multiple of $4^1$ that goes into $15$ without going over is $3\\cdot 4^1=12$, so $3$ will be the digit in the $4^1$ place. Since $15-12=3$, we can also see that $3$ will be the digit in the $4^0$ place. We now know that $527_{10}=20033_{4}$. The sum of the digits of $20033_{4}$ is $2+0+0+3+3=\\boxed{8}$.

  "We know that the five-digit number must be divisible by each of its non-zero digits. We should include the digit zero since it does not have to be included as a possible divisor and it will keep the integer smaller. Knowing this, the least possible five-digit number that we could try is $10,234$. Any number we choose will be divisible by one. We also see that it is even, and therefore, divisible by two. However, the two-digit number formed by its last two digit ($34$) is not divisible by four, and therefore, neither is the five-digit number. We also see that the sum of the five digits is $10$, and since $10$ is not divisible by three, neither is the five-digit number. However, notice that by increasing the five-digit number by two to form the number $10,236$, we create another even number and increase the digit-sum to $12$ (which takes care of the number being divisible by three). We have now eliminated the digit of four and added the digit of six, which is fine because $10,236$ being divisible by both two and three means that it is divisible by six. Our five-digit number is $\\boxed{10,\\!236}$. The answer is 10,\\!236.",

  "We could use long division to find the decimal representations of the three fractions, but there's a slicker way.\n\nWe begin by finding an equivalent fraction whose denominator is 1 less than a power of 10.

  "First, $2005^2 = 4020025$, so the last two digits of $2005^2$ are 25.\n\nWe need to look at $2005^5$, but since we only need the final two digits, we don't actually have to calculate this number entirely.\n\nConsider $2005^3 = 2005^2 \\times 2005 = 4020025 \\times 2005$.  When we carry out this multiplication, the last two digits of the product will only depend on the last two digits of the each of the two numbers being multiplied (try this by hand!), so the last two digits of $2005^3$ are the same as the last two digits of $25 \\times 5 = 125$, ie. are 25.\n\nSimilarly, to calculate $2005^4$, we multiply $2005^3$ (which ends in 25) by $2005$, so by the same reasoning $2005^4$ ends in 25. Similarly, $2005^5$ ends in 25.\n\nTherefore, $2005^2$ and $2005^5$ both end in 25.\n\nAlso, $2005^0 = 1$, so the expression overall is equal to $$\\ldots 25 + 1 + 1 + \\ldots 25 = \\ldots 52.$$Therefore, the final two digits are $\\boxed{52}$.

  "We start subtract the rightmost digits, keeping in mind that we are in base $5$.\n\nSince $1$ is less than $4$, we must borrow $1$ from the $2$, which then becomes $1$. Since $11_5-4_5=2_5$, we have $2$ in the rightmost digit. Since the $1$ left over is less than $3$, we must borrow $1$ from the $3$, which becomes a $2$. Next, $11_5-3_5=3_5$, so we have $3$ in the second rightmost digit. Since $2-2=0$, the third digit is 0. We subtract $1$ from $4$ to get $3$ for the fourth digit. In column format, this process reads $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & &4 & \\cancelto{2}{3}& \\cancelto{1}{2} & 1_5\\\\ & -& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4_5\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 3 & 0 & 3& 2_5\\\\ \\end{array} $$The difference is $\\boxed{3032_5}$.

  "We know that $6^{4}>999_{10}>6^{3}$. So, we can tell that $999_{10}$ in base six will have four digits. $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 999 four times at most, leaving $999-4\\cdot216 = 135$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 135 three times at most, leaving us with $135-3\\cdot36 = 27$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 27 four times at most, leaving $27-4\\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. All together, the base six equivalent of $999_{10}$ is $\\boxed{4343_6}$. The answer is 4343_6.",
  "Recall the identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b)=ab$, which holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.

The possibilities are $1$ and $11$.\n\nIn fact, $9999=11\\cdot 909$, so $11$ is a divisor of $9999$ and $100001$, which gives $\\gcd(9999,100001) = 11$.\n\nTherefore, \\begin{align*}\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] &= \\frac{9999\\cdot 100001}{11} \\\\\n&= 909\\cdot 100001 \\\\\n&= 909\\cdot 100000 + 909 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{90{,}900{,}909}.\n\\end{align*} The answer is 90{,}900{,}909.",
  "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then $n = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7 = 7(2k+1)$. Since $7(2k+1)$ is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is $\\boxed{0}$. The answer is 0.",
  "To find the pattern of the sequence, we begin by converting each of the decimal values into a common fraction. The first term $0$ is equal to $\\frac{0}{1}$. The next term, $0.5$, can be written as $\\frac{5}{10}=\\frac{1}{2}$. To express $0.\\overline{6}$ as a common fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10x &=& 6&.66666\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.66666\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9x &=& 6 &\n\\end{array}$$\n\nThis shows that $0.\\overline{6} = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}$. The fourth term in the series, $0.75$, becomes $\\frac{75}{100}=\\frac{3}{4}$. Thus, when we write fractions instead of decimals, our sequence is: $$\\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\cdots$$  By observing this sequence, we realize that the first term of the sequence is $\\frac{0}{1}$ and each successive term is found by adding $1$ to both the numerator and denominator of the previous term.

  "First, for simplicity, let's make all the amounts of money into integers by considering them all in cents. For example, $\\$5.43$ becomes 543. Let the purchase price be $A=A_1A_2A_3$ and the amount of change be $B_1B_2B_3$ where $A_1$ represents the first digit of $A$, $B_1$ represents the first digit of $B$, $A_2$ represents the second digit of $A$, etc.\n\nWe know that $A+B=1000$, and we can conclude that $A_1+B_1=9$ because if $A_1+B_1<9$ then $A+B<1000$ and if $A_1+B_1=10$ then $A_2=B_2=A_3=B_3=0$, but then the only way that B can be a rearrangement of the digits of A is if $A_1=B_1=5$, which means $A=B=500$, but the problem states that the price and the amount of change are different.\n\nSince 9 is odd, we can also conclude that $A_1$ and $B_1$ are distinct, which, using the fact that $A$'s digits can be rearranged to get B's digits, implies that $A_1=B_2$ or $A_1=B_3$ and $B_1=A_2$ or $B_1=A_3$. We can also observe that A and B have the same remainder when divided by 9 because the remainder when $n$ is divided by 9 is equal to the remainder when the sum of the digits of $n$ is divided by 9 for all $n$ and the sum of the digits of A is obviously equal to the sum of the digits of B.\n\nSince the remainder when 1000 is divided by 9 is 1, we can in fact conclude that the remainder when A and B are divided by 9 (and when the sum of their digits is divided by 9) is 5. Keeping in mind that two of the digits of $A$ are $A_1$ and $B_1$ and that $A_1+B_1=9$, we can conclude that the other digit is 5, which is the only digit that would result in the sum having a remainder of 5 when divided by 9. By similar logic we can conclude that 5 is also one of the digits of $B$. A little thought makes it clear that at least one of these 5's appears as the last digit in its number (that is, $A_3=5$ or $B_3=5$) since if neither of them appears as the last digit in a number, then $A_1=B_3$ and $B_1=A_3$ and $A_3+B_3=9\\Rightarrow A+B$ ends in a 9, which is a contradiction. But if $A_3=5$ then the only way for the sum of $A$ and $B$ to end in a 0 is for $B_3=5$, so we can conclude that $A_3=B_3=5$, $A_1=B_2$, and $A_2=B_1$. So once we have picked a value for $A_1$, the other 5 digits are all determined. Since both amounts are greater than a dollar, we know that $A_1$ can be any number between 1 and 8 for a total of 8 possible prices (and thus 8 possible amounts of change). To double check, we can work out $A$ and $B$ for each value of $A_1$ and reconvert them to dollars to make sure that the price and the amount of change satisfy the given conditions:\n\n$A_1=1\\Rightarrow A=\\$1.85, B=\\$8.15$;\n\n$A_1=2\\Rightarrow A=\\$2.75, B=\\$7.25$;\n\n$A_1=3\\Rightarrow A=\\$3.65, B=\\$6.35$;\n\n$A_1=4\\Rightarrow A=\\$4.55, B=\\$5.45$;\n\n$A_1=5\\Rightarrow A=\\$5.45, B=\\$4.55$;\n\n$A_1=6\\Rightarrow A=\\$6.35, B=\\$3.65$;\n\n$A_1=7\\Rightarrow A=\\$7.25, B=\\$2.75$; and finally\n\n$A_1=8\\Rightarrow A=\\$8.15, B=\\$1.85$.\n\nThis confirms that there are $\\boxed{8}$ possible amounts of change. The answer is 8.",

  "First we consider integers that have $2$ digits in base $2$ and $1$ digit in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $10_2 = 2$, but strictly less than $10_3 = 3$. The only such integer is $2$.\n\nNext we consider integers that have $4$ digits in base $2$ and $2$ digits in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $1000_2 = 2^3$, but strictly less than $100_3 = 3^2$. The only such integer is $8$.\n\nNext we consider integers that have $6$ digits in base $2$ and $3$ digits in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $100000_2 = 2^5$, but strictly less than $1000_3 = 3^3$. There are no such integers, because $2^5 > 3^3$.\n\nIf we continue in this fashion, we may come to suspect that there are no more solutions of any length. Let us prove this. If an integer $N$ has $2d$ digits in base $2$, then $N\\ge 2^{2d-1}$. But if $N$ has only $d$ digits in base $3$, then $N<3^d$. A mutual solution is possible only if $$2^{2d-1}<3^d.$$We can rearrange this inequality as $$\\left(\\frac 43\\right)^d < 2.$$By inspection, this inequality is valid for $d=1,2$ but invalid for $d=3$, and also invalid for any larger $d$ since the left side increases as $d$ increases. This shows that there are no solutions $N$ beyond those we found already: $2$ and $8$, whose sum is $\\boxed{10}$. The answer is 10.",

  "The common difference of the arithmetic sequence 106, 116, 126, ..., 996 is relatively prime to 3.  Therefore, given any three consecutive terms, exactly one of them is divisible by 3.  Since there are $1+(996-106)/10=90$ terms in the sequence, $90/3=30$ of them are divisible by 3.  Since every term is even, a term is divisible by 3 if and only if it is divisible by 6.  Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected term in the sequence is a multiple of 6 is $30/90=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$. The answer is \\frac{1}{3}."
