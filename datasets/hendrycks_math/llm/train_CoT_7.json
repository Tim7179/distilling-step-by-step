  "Let $O_i$ be the center of circle $\\omega_i$ for $i=1,2,3$, and let $K$ be the intersection of lines $O_1P_1$ and $O_2P_2$.

  "We let the side length of the base of the box be $x$, so the height of the box is $x+3$. The surface area of each box then is $2x^2 + 4(x)(x+3)$.

  "Divide the boundary of the square into halves, thereby forming $8$ segments. Without loss of generality, let the first point $A$ be in the bottom-left segment.

  "There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region. Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).\nWe first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.\nLet the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$. From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional.\nIn the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$. Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$, $\\frac s{2}$, $\\frac s{5}$, and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a $9\\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points. Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\\boxed{2320}$. The answer is 2320.",

Now, it is clear that $GB = DE + 1 = 4x + 1$, so $AH = AG = 8 - GB = 7 - 4x$ since $AH$ and $AG$ are both tangent to the circle P at some point. We can apply the same logic to the other side as well to get $CI = 5 - 3x$. Finally, since we have $HI = DF = 5x$, we have $AC = 10 = (7 - 4x) + (5x) + (5 - 3x) = 12 - 2x$, so $x = 1$ and $3x + 4x + 5x = \\boxed{12}$ The answer is 12.",

Take any right triangle with legs parallel to the axes and a hypotenuse with slope $12 \\div 2 = 6$, e.g. the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,6)$. Then quick calculations show that the medians to the legs have slopes $12$ and $3$. Now translate the triangle (without rotating it) so that its medians intersect at the point where the lines $y=12x+2$ and $y=3x+1$ intersect. This forces the medians to lie on these lines (since their slopes are determined, and now we force them to go through a particular point; a slope and a point uniquely determine a line). Finally, for any central dilation of this triangle (a larger or smaller triangle with the same centroid and sides parallel to this one's sides), the medians will still lie on these lines, showing the \"infinitely many\" part of the result.\nHence, to sum up, $m$ can in fact be both $12$ or $\\frac{3}{4}$, which is exactly $\\boxed{2}$ values.

Since $XOZB$ is a square (tangents are perpendicular to radius), $r = BX = BZ = y$. The perimeter can be expressed as $2(x+y+z)$, so the semiperimeter is $x+y+z$. The hypotenuse is $AY+CY = z+x$.

  "As we are dealing with volumes, the ratio of the volume of $P'$ to $P$ is the cube of the ratio of the height of $P'$ to $P$.\nThus, the height of $P$ is $\\sqrt [3]{8} = 2$ times the height of $P'$, and thus the height of each is $12$.\nThus, the top of the frustum is a rectangle $A'B'C'D'$ with $A'B' = 6$ and $B'C' = 8$.\nNow, consider the plane that contains diagonal $AC$ as well as the altitude of $P$. Taking the cross section of the frustum along this plane gives the trapezoid $ACC'A'$, inscribed in an equatorial circular section of the sphere. It suffices to consider this circle.\nFirst, we want the length of $AC$. This is given by the Pythagorean Theorem over triangle $ABC$ to be $20$. Thus, $A'C' = 10$. Since the height of this trapezoid is $12$, and $AC$ extends a distance of $5$ on either direction of $A'C'$, we can use a 5-12-13 triangle to determine that $AA' = CC' = 13$.\nNow, we wish to find a point equidistant from $A$, $A'$, and $C$. By symmetry, this point, namely $X$, must lie on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$. Let $X$ be $h$ units from $A'C'$ in $ACC'A'$. By the Pythagorean Theorem twice,\\begin{align*} 5^2 + h^2 & = r^2 \\\\ 10^2 + (12 - h)^2 & = r^2 \\end{align*}Subtracting gives $75 + 144 - 24h = 0 \\Longrightarrow h = \\frac {73}{8}$.

  "The perpendicular bisector of any chord of any circle passes through the center of that circle. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$, and $R$ be the length of the radius of $\\omega$.

Since $X$ is the midpoint of chord $CD$, both $CX$ and $XD$ must be 4 units long. We are also told that circle $O$ has a radius of 6 units. This means that $OD$ must be 6 units long. Because we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $OX$. We get  \\begin{align*}\nOX^{2}+XD^{2}&=OD^{2}\\\\\nOX^{2}&=OD^{2}-XD^{2}\\\\\nOX&=\\sqrt{OD^{2}-XD^{2}}\\\\\nOX&=\\sqrt{6^2-4^2}\\\\\nOX&=\\sqrt{20}.\n\\end{align*} Now let's draw a segment from $D$ to a point $Y$ on segment $KA$ that is perpendicular to both $CD$ and $KA$.

If we construct an altitude, it will divide the equilateral triangle into two congruent $30-60-90$ triangles with the longest side having length $s$ and the altitude opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle. Since the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle are in a $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$ ratio, the altitude will have length $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Since the base of this equilateral triangle is $s$, its area will be $\\frac{1}{2}{b}{h}=\\frac{1}{2}s \\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nNow we can set this expression equal to $64\\sqrt{3}$ and solve for $s$ to find the side length of our original triangle.

To find the $x$-coordinate, we solve $t=-x+8$ to get $x = 8-t$.\n\nTherefore, $T$ has coordinates $(\\frac{1}{4}(8-t),t)$, $U$ has coordinates $(8-t,t)$, and $A$ is at $(0,8)$.\n\n$TU$ is horizontal and has length $(8-t)-\\frac{1}{4}(8-t)=\\frac{3}{4}(8-t)$ and the distance from $TU$ to $A$ is $8-t$, so the area in terms of $t$ is \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}(8-t)\\right)(8-t) = \\frac{3}{8}(8-t)^2.\\]Since this equals $13.5$, we have $\\frac{3}{8}(8-t)^2 = 13.5$ or $(8-t)^2 = \\frac{8}{3}(13.5)=36$.

Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\\boxed{6}$ days. The answer is 6.",

  "First we'll simplify that complicated expression.

We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \\neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \\geq 0$ so that $p + q \\neq 0.$\n\nAlso because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides.
