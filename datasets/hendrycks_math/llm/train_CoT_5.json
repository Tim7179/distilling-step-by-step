  "Let us suppose for convenience that there were $n + 10$ players overall. Among the $n$ players not in the weakest 10 there were $n \\choose 2$ games played and thus $n \\choose 2$ points earned. By the givens, this means that these $n$ players also earned $n \\choose 2$ points against our weakest 10. Now, the 10 weakest players playing amongst themselves played ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ games and so earned 45 points playing each other. Then they also earned 45 points playing against the stronger $n$ players. Since every point earned falls into one of these categories, It follows that the total number of points earned was $2{n \\choose 2} + 90 = n^2 - n + 90$. However, there was one point earned per game, and there were a total of ${n + 10 \\choose 2} = \\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ games played and thus $\\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ points earned. So we have $n^2 -n + 90 = \\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ so $2n^2 - 2n + 180 = n^2 + 19n + 90$ and $n^2 -21n + 90 = 0$ and $n = 6$ or $n = 15$. Now, note that the top $n$ players got $n(n - 1)$ points in total (by our previous calculation) for an average of $n - 1$, while the bottom 10 got 90 points total, for an average of 9. Thus we must have $n > 10$, so $n = 15$ and the answer is $15 + 10 = \\boxed{25}$. The answer is 25.",
  "Let's consider each of the sequences of two coin tosses as an operation instead; this operation takes a string and adds the next coin toss on (eg, THHTH + HT = THHTHT). We examine what happens to the last coin toss. Adding HH or TT is simply an identity for the last coin toss, so we will ignore them for now. However, adding HT or TH switches the last coin. H switches to T three times, but T switches to H four times; hence it follows that our string will have a structure of THTHTHTH.\nNow we have to count all of the different ways we can add the identities back in. There are 5 TT subsequences, which means that we have to add 5 T into the strings, as long as the new Ts are adjacent to existing Ts. There are already 4 Ts in the sequence, and since order doesn’t matter between different tail flips this just becomes the ball-and-urn argument. We want to add 5 balls into 4 urns, which is the same as 3 dividers; hence this gives ${{5+3}\\choose3} = 56$ combinations. We do the same with 2 Hs to get ${{2+3}\\choose3} = 10$ combinations; thus there are $56 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{560}$ possible sequences. The answer is 560.",
  "If any of $r_1, \\ldots, r_{19}$ is larger than $r_{20}$, one of these numbers will be compared with $r_{20}$ on the 19th step of the first bubble pass and $r_{20}$ will be moved back to the 19th position. Thus, $r_{20}$ must be the largest of the first 20 terms. In addition, $r_{20}$ must be larger than $r_{21}, r_{22}, \\ldots, r_{30}$ but smaller than $r_{31}$ in order that it move right to the 30th position but then not continue moving right to the 31st.\nThus, our problem can be restated: What is the probability that in a sequence of 31 distinct real numbers, the largest is in position 31 and the second-largest is in position 20 (the other 29 numbers are irrelevant)?\nThis is much easier to solve: there are $31!$ ways to order the first thirty-one numbers and $29!$ ways to arrange them so that the largest number is in the 31st position and the second-largest is in the 20th. This gives us a desired probability of $\\frac{29!}{31!} = \\frac{1}{31\\cdot 30} = \\frac{1}{930}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{931}$. The answer is 931.",
  "Since $8$ had already been added to the pile, the numbers $1 \\ldots 7$ had already been added at some time to the pile; $9$ might or might not have been added yet. So currently $S$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots 7\\}$, possibly with $9$ at the end. Given that $S$ has $k$ elements, there are $k+1$ intervals for $9$ to be inserted, or $9$ might have already been placed, giving $k+2$ different possibilities.\nThus, the answer is $\\sum_{k=0}^{7} {7 \\choose k}(k+2)$ $= 1 \\cdot 2 + 7 \\cdot 3 + 21 \\cdot 4 + 35 \\cdot 5 + 35 \\cdot 6 + 21 \\cdot 7 + 7 \\cdot 8 + 1 \\cdot 9$ $= \\boxed{704}$.

  "We first show that we can choose at most 5 numbers from $\\{1, 2, \\ldots , 11\\}$ such that no two numbers have a difference of $4$ or $7$. We take the smallest number to be $1$, which rules out $5,8$. Now we can take at most one from each of the pairs: $[2,9]$, $[3,7]$, $[4,11]$, $[6,10]$. Now, $1989 = 180\\cdot 11 + 9$. Because this isn't an exact multiple of $11$, we need to consider some numbers separately.\nNotice that $1969 = 180\\cdot11 - 11 = 179\\cdot11$. Therefore we can put the last $1969$ numbers into groups of 11. Now let's examine $\\{1, 2, \\ldots , 20\\}$. If we pick $1, 3, 4, 6, 9$ from the first $11$ numbers, then we're allowed to pick $11 + 1$, $11 + 3$, $11 + 4$, $11 + 6$, $11 + 9$. This means we get 10 members from the 20 numbers.

  "We have the smallest stack, which has a height of $94 \\times 4$ inches. Now when we change the height of one of the bricks, we either add $0$ inches, $6$ inches, or $15$ inches to the height.

  "For each $i$th switch (designated by $x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}$), it advances itself only one time at the $i$th step; thereafter, only a switch with larger $x_{j},y_{j},z_{j}$ values will advance the $i$th switch by one step provided $d_{i}= 2^{x_{i}}3^{y_{i}}5^{z_{i}}$ divides $d_{j}= 2^{x_{j}}3^{y_{j}}5^{z_{j}}$. Let $N = 2^{9}3^{9}5^{9}$ be the max switch label. To find the divisor multiples in the range of $d_{i}$ to $N$, we consider the exponents of the number $\\frac{N}{d_{i}}= 2^{9-x_{i}}3^{9-y_{i}}5^{9-z_{i}}$.

The same calculation works for the blue candies.\nThe probability that Terry picks two different candies is $\\frac{20\\cdot10}{20\\cdot19} = \\frac{10}{19}$, and the probability that Mary picks two different candies after Terry picks two different candies is $\\frac{18\\cdot 9}{18\\cdot 17} = \\frac{9}{17}$. Thus, the probability that they both choose two different candies is $\\frac{10}{19}\\cdot\\frac{9}{17} = \\frac{90}{323}$. Then the total probability is\n\\[2 \\cdot \\frac{14}{323} + \\frac{90}{323} = \\frac{118}{323}\\]\nand so the answer is $118 + 323 = \\boxed{441}$.\nIn the above calculations, we treated the choices as ordered; that is, Terry chose first one candy, then a second, and so on. We could also solve the problem using unordered choices. The probabilities calculated will all be the same, but the calculations will appear somewhat different. For instance, the probability that Mary chooses two red candies after Terry chose two red candies will have the form $\\frac{{8\\choose 2}}{{18 \\choose 2}}$, and the probability that Terry chooses two different candies will have the form $\\frac{{10\\choose 1}\\cdot{10\\choose 1}}{{20\\choose2}}$. It is not difficult to see that these yield the same results as our calculations above, as we would expect. The answer is 441.",
  "First, let's count numbers with only a single digit. We have nine of these for each length, and four lengths, so 36 total numbers.\nNow, let's count those with two distinct digits. We handle the cases \"0 included\" and \"0 not included\" separately.\nThere are ${9 \\choose 2}$ ways to choose two digits, $A$ and $B$. Given two digits, there are $2^n - 2$ ways to arrange them in an $n$-digit number, for a total of $(2^1 - 2) + (2^2 - 2) + (2^3 -2) + (2^4 - 2) = 22$ such numbers (or we can list them: $AB, BA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB, BBA, AAAB, AABA, ABAA,$ $BAAA, AABB, ABAB, BAAB, ABBA, BABA, BBAA, ABBB, BABB, BBAB, BBBA$). Thus, we have ${9 \\choose 2} \\cdot 22 = 36\\cdot22 = 792$ numbers of this form.\nNow, suppose 0 is one of our digits. We have nine choices for the other digit.

Casework upon the number of diagonal moves:\nCase $d = 1$: It is easy to see only $2$ cases.\nCase $d = 2$: There are two diagonals. We need to generate a string with $3$ $R$'s, $3$ $U$'s, and $2$ $D$'s such that no two $R$'s or $U$'s are adjacent. The $D$'s split the string into three sections ($-D-D-$): by the Pigeonhole principle all of at least one of the two letters must be all together (i.e., stay in a row).\nIf both $R$ and $U$ stay together, then there are $3 \\cdot 2=6$ ways.\nIf either $R$ or $U$ splits, then there are $3$ places to put the letter that splits, which has $2$ possibilities. The remaining letter must divide into $2$ in one section and $1$ in the next, giving $2$ ways. This totals $6 + 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 2 = 18$ ways.\nCase $d = 3$: Now $2$ $R$'s, $2$ $U$'s, and $3$ $D$'s, so the string is divided into $4$ partitions ($-D-D-D-$).\nIf the $R$'s and $U$'s stay together, then there are $4 \\cdot 3 = 12$ places to put them.\nIf one of them splits and the other stays together, then there are $4 \\cdot {3\\choose 2}$ places to put them, and $2$ ways to pick which splits, giving $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways.\nIf both groups split, then there are ${4\\choose 2}=6$ ways to arrange them.

There are $5$ places to put $R$, $4$ places to put $U$, giving $20$ ways.\nCase $d = 5$: It is easy to see only $1$ case.\nTogether, these add up to $2 + 18 + 42 + 20 + 1 = \\boxed{83}$.

To avoid making two faces touch, we cannot have the arrangement HT. Thus, all possible configurations must be a string of tails followed by a string of heads, since after the first H no more tails can appear. The first H can occur in a maximum of eight times different positions, and then there is also the possibility that it doesn’t occur at all, for $9$ total configurations.

  "We proceed recursively. Suppose we can build $T_m$ towers using blocks of size $1, 2, \\ldots, m$. How many towers can we build using blocks of size $1, 2, \\ldots, m, m + 1$?

We solve this problem by introducing an extra blue, such that we choose our divider by choosing one of these $a+1$ blues, and not including that one as a flag on either pole.\nFrom (1), we now have ${a+2\\choose b}$ ways to order the string such that no greens are next to each other, and $a+1$ ways to choose the extra blue that will divide the string into the two poles: or $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}$ orderings in total.\nHowever, we have overcounted the solutions where either pole has no flags, we have to count these separately.

  "Call a beef meal $B,$ a chicken meal $C,$ and a fish meal $F.$ Now say the nine people order meals $\\text{BBBCCCFFF}$ respectively and say that the person who receives the correct meal is the first person. We will solve for this case and then multiply by $9$ to account for the $9$ different ways in which the person to receive the correct meal could be picked.

For example, two people who order chicken are separate, though if they receive fish, there is only 1 way to order them.\nThe problem we must solve is to distribute meals $\\text{BBCCCFFF}$ to orders $\\text{BBCCCFFF}$ with no matches. The two people who ordered $B$'s can either both get $C$'s, both get $F$'s, or get one $C$ and one $F.$ We proceed with casework.\nIf the two $B$ people both get $C$'s, then the three $F$ meals left to distribute must all go to the $C$ people. The $F$ people then get $BBC$ in some order, which gives three possibilities. The indistinguishability is easier to see here, as we distribute the $F$ meals to the $C$ people, and there is only 1 way to order this, as all three meals are the same.\nIf the two $B$ people both get $F$'s, the situation is identical to the above and three possibilities arise.\nIf the two $B$ people get $CF$ in some order, then the $C$ people must get $FFB$ and the $F$ people must get $CCB.$ This gives $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 18$ possibilities.\nSumming across the cases we see there are $24$ possibilities, so the answer is $9 \\cdot 24 = \\boxed{216}$.

  "Okay, an exercise in counting (lots of binomials to calculate!). In base 2, the first number is $11111111$, which is the only way to choose 8 1's out of 8 spaces, or $\\binom{8}{8}$.

For 11 spaces, there are $\\binom{11}{8}=165$, which includes the first 45. You're getting the handle. For 12 spaces, there are $\\binom{12}{8}=495$, which includes the first 165; for 13 spaces, there are $\\binom{13}{8}=13 \\cdot 99 > 1000$, so we now know that $N$ has exactly 13 spaces, so the $2^{12}$ digit is 1.\nNow we just proceed with the other 12 spaces with 7 1's, and we're looking for the $1000-495=505th$ number. Well, $\\binom{11}{7}=330$, so we know that the $2^{11}$ digit also is 1, and we're left with finding the $505-330=175th$ number with 11 spaces and 6 1's. Now $\\binom{10}{6}=210,$ which is too big, but $\\binom{9}{6}=84.$ Thus, the $2^9$ digit is 1, and we're now looking for the $175-84=91st$ number with 9 spaces and 5 1's.

We would like a better condition to determine if a given pairing is bad.\nNote that, in order to have a bad pairing, there must exist a collection of $k<5$ pairs that includes both the left and the right shoes of $k$ adults; in other words, it is bad if it is possible to pick $k$ pairs and properly redistribute all of its shoes to exactly $k$ people.\nThus, if a left shoe is a part of a bad collection, its corresponding right shoe must also be in the bad collection (and vice versa). To search for bad collections, we can start at an arbitrary right shoe (say $R_1$), check the left shoe it is paired with (say $L_i$), and from the previous observation, we know that $R_i$ must also be in the bad collection. Then we may check the left shoe paired with $R_i$, find its counterpart, check its left pair, find its counterpart, etc. until we have found $L_1$. We can imagine each right shoe \"sending\" us to another right shoe (via its paired left shoe) until we reach the starting right shoe, at which point we know that we have found a bad collection if we have done this less than $5$ times.\nEffectively we have just traversed a cycle. (Note: This is the cycle notation of permutations.)

For the second one, $a_4 \\ge 3$, $a_5 \\ge 6$, $a_6 \\ge 18$, and $a_7 \\ge 54$, by which point we see that this function diverges.\nTherefore, the only scenarios where $a_n=0$ is when any of the following are met: $|y-x|<2$ (280 options) $|z-y|<2$ (280 options, 80 of which coincide with option 1) $z=1$, $|y-x|=2$. (16 options, 2 of which coincide with either option 1 or option 2) Adding the total number of such ordered triples yields $280+280-80+16-2=\\boxed{494}$. The answer is 494.",

There are $\\binom{15}{2}$ ways to partition $16$. Since $a$ could be any of the four sides, we have counted $4\\binom{15}{2}$ degenerate quadrilaterals. Similarly, there are $4\\binom{14}{2}$, $4\\binom{13}{2} \\cdots 4\\binom{2}{2}$ for other values of $a$.

If the quadrilateral is a rectangle (and not a square), it will be counted twice. In all other cases, it will be counted 4 times. Since there is $1$ square case, and $7$ rectangle cases, there are $2255-1-2\\cdot7=2240$ quadrilaterals counted 4 times. Thus there are $1+7+\\frac{2240}{4} = \\boxed{568}$ total quadrilaterals.

  "This question can be solved fairly directly by casework and pattern-finding. We give a somewhat more general attack, based on the solution to the following problem:\nHow many ways are there to choose $k$ elements from an ordered $n$ element set without choosing two consecutive members?\nYou want to choose $k$ numbers out of $n$ with no consecutive numbers. For each configuration, we can subtract $i-1$ from the $i$-th element in your subset. This converts your configuration into a configuration with $k$ elements where the largest possible element is $n-k+1$, with no restriction on consecutive numbers. Since this process is easily reversible, we have a bijection. Without consideration of the second condition, we have: ${15 \\choose 1} + {14 \\choose 2} + {13 \\choose 3} + ... + {9 \\choose 7} + {8 \\choose 8}$\nNow we examine the second condition. It simply states that no element in our original configuration (and hence also the modified configuration, since we don't move the smallest element) can be less than $k$, which translates to subtracting $k - 1$ from the \"top\" of each binomial coefficient. Now we have, after we cancel all the terms ${n \\choose k}$ where $n < k$, ${15 \\choose 1} + {13 \\choose 2} + {11 \\choose 3} + {9 \\choose 4} + {7 \\choose 5}=  15 + 78 + 165 + 126 + 21 = \\boxed{405}$ The answer is 405.",

  "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.

If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$. The answer is \\dfrac{421}{1296}.",

Therefore, in the case $J = 1$, there are $4! \\cdot 2^4 = 384$ ways to label the vertices.\n\nThe cases $J = 5$ and $J = 9$ are the same, and also produce $384$ valid ways. Thus, the total number of ways to label the vertices is $3 \\cdot 384 = \\boxed{1152}.$ The answer is 1152.",
  "There are four possible cases for the Cubs winning the World Series, depending on the number of games that Red Sox win before the Cubs win their fourth game: the Red Sox can win no games, one game, two games, or three games. In general, if the Red Sox win exactly $k$ games before the Cubs win their 4th game, there will be a total of $3+k$ games played before the last one (which the Cubs must win), there will be a total of $\\dbinom{3+k}{k}$ ways of selecting the games that the Red Sox win out of those, and for each of those arrangements the Cubs will win their 4 games with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4$ and the Red Sox will win the $k$ games that are selected for them with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^k$, so we are left to evaluate the expression $\\dbinom{3+k}{k}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$.

  "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$. The answer is 576.",

So, if we add together the $k^{th}$ terms of the expansions of $(10-2)^{25}$ and $(10+2)^{25}$, we get double the value of the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10+2)^{25}$, that is, $2 \\cdot \\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot 2^k$, if $k$ is even, and 0 if $k$ is odd.

  "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the fourth letter cannot be P. One way to solve this is to consider the permutations of all 7 letters where the first four satisfy these conditions, and then divide to correct for overcounting. Once we have placed the L, we have 5 options for where to place the P--- any spot except the fourth one, which will become the last one when we remove the last three letters. We can then place the remaining 5 letters without restriction, which there are $5!$ ways to do. This gives us a preliminary count of $5\\times5!=600$. However, no matter what the order of the last three letters, we will still get the same sequence of the first 4 letters; for example, LPROMEB, LPROEBM, and LPROBEM and three other permutations all have the first 4 letters LPRO. Because of this, each sequence of 4 letters has been counted exactly 6 times so our answer is $\\dfrac{5\\times5!}{6}=\\boxed{100}$.\n\nAlternative solution by stevenmeow: There are 5 ways to choose the last letter (B, R, O, M, or E) and the L must go first.

  "Because of the symmetric nature of the number 11, it is a divisor of many palindromes.

If we let one of those two extra years be a leap year, and we have one leap year in each of the 37 blocks, then we have 38 leap years.

Since $MQ = \\frac{1}{2}PQ$, then the corresponding sides of $\\triangle MXQ$ are half as long as those of $\\triangle PLQ$.\n\nTherefore, $QX=\\frac{1}{2}QL=\\frac{1}{2}(1)=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $MX = \\frac{1}{2}PL = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nSince $QX=\\frac{1}{2}$, then $RX = RQ-QX = 4 - \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{7}{2}$.\n\nNow $\\triangle RLF$ is similar to $\\triangle RXM$ (they are each right-angled and share a common angle at $R$).\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{FL}{MX}=\\frac{RL}{RX}$ so $FL = \\frac{(MX)(RL)}{RX}=\\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(3)}{\\frac{7}{2}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{7}$.\n\nThus, $PF = \\sqrt{3} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{7}}$.

Thus, $\\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\\sqrt{2}EB = \\sqrt{2}(1-x)$.  Also, $\\triangle EGB$ and $\\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \\frac{EB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAlso, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\\triangle AED \\cong \\triangle GED$.  This means that $AD=GD=1$.\n\nLastly, notice that since $G$ is on $BD$, we have $BD=BG+GD$. $BD$ is a diagonal of the square, so it has side length $\\sqrt{2}$, $GD=1$, and $GB = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Thus, our equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\] Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$ yields $2=\\sqrt{2}+1-x$; solving for $x$ yields $x=\\sqrt{2}-1$.  Thus, $AE=\\sqrt{2}-1=\\sqrt{k}-m$, and we see that $k+m=2+1=\\boxed{3}$. The answer is 3.",
  "Suppose that the altitude from $F$ to $EG$ intersects $EG$ at point $H$.  Then $\\triangle EAB \\sim \\triangle EHF$, and we have that $\\frac{HE}{HF} = \\frac{AE}{AB}$.  Also, $\\triangle GDC \\sim GHF$, and $\\frac{HG}{HF} = \\frac{DG}{DC}$.  Adding these equalities, we find that $\\frac{HE + HG}{HF} = \\frac{AE + DG}{AB}$, since $AB = DC$.  But $HE + HG = EG = 10$, $HF = 7$, and finally $AE + DG = EG - AD = 10 - 2AB$.  Plugging in, we find that $\\frac{10}{7} = \\frac{10-2AB}{AB}$, or $AB = \\frac{35}{12}$.  Thus the area of $ABCD$ is $\\frac{35}{12}\\cdot\\frac{35}{6} =\\boxed{ \\frac{1225}{72}}$. The answer is \\frac{1225}{72}."
