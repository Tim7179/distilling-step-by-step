  "To do this problem rigorously, simply note that if $n$ is your number, the sum of it and its square is: $n^2 + n = n(n+1) = 156$.

Since the function $f$ is defined piecewise, to find this value, we must consider both cases $x \\le 1$ and $x > 1$.\n\nIf $x \\le 1$ and $f(x) = -3$, then $2 - x = -3$, which leads to $x = 5$.  But this value does not satisfy the condition $x \\le 1$.  If $x > 1$ and $f(x) = -3$, then $2x - x^2 = -3$, or $x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$.  This equation factors as $(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0$, so $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.  The only value that satisfies the condition $x > 1$ is $x = 3$, so $f^{-1}(-3) = 3$.\n\nNext, we compute $f^{-1}(0)$, which is the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$.\n\nIf $x \\le 1$ and $f(x) = 0$, then $2 - x = 0$, which leads to $x = 2$.

  "Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=400-4ac=0$, so $ac=\\frac{400}{4}=100$. We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=29$ and $ac=100$. We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=29$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=29^2=841.$$We subtract $4ac=400$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=841-400=441.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\\sqrt{(c-a)^2}=c-a=\\sqrt{441}=21.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $c>a$ we know $c-a>0$.) Thus we have  \\begin{align*}\nc-a&=21\\\\\nc+a&=29\n\\end{align*}Summing these equations gives \\begin{align*}\n2c&=50\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=25,\n\\end{align*}and $a=29-c=4$.

This means that we want the product of the positive integral solutions to $n^2-35n+306=2$, or $n^2-35n+304=0$.\n\nThe problem tells us that there is at least one positive integral solution. Now we use the fact that the product of the solutions to a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $c/a$, which equals 304 in this case. This means that both solutions must in fact be positive, since if only one were, their product would be negative. Additionally, the sum of the solutions is given by $-b/a$, which is 35 in this case. Since one solution is integral, and the sum of both solutions is integral, the other solution is integral as well. So we want the product of both, which is $\\boxed{304}$. The answer is 304.",

Since $17b+27c = 10(b+2c) + 7(b+c)$, $7(b+c)$ is also a multiple of 10. 10 cannot divide 7, so 10 divides $b+c$. Janice bought 30 items, so the reasonable values of $b+c$ are $0, 10, 20, 30$. If $b+c = 0$, then $17b+27c = 0$, which isn't true. If $b+c=20$, then the least possible value of $17b+27c$ is $17\\cdot20 = 340$, which is also impossible. By the same reasoning $b+c=30$ is also impossible. We conclude that $b+c= 10$, namely that $b=6$ and $c=4$ to satisfy $17b+27c = 210$. Thus $a = 30-(b+c) = \\boxed{20}$. The answer is 20.",

Simplifying, we obtain $\\frac{1+2\\sqrt{3}+3}{1-3}$ = $\\frac{4+2\\sqrt{3}}{-2} = -2-\\sqrt{3}$. Thus $A=-2$, $B=-1$, $C=3$, and $ABC=\\boxed{6}$. The answer is 6.",
  "Since $|x|$ is nonnegative, it is minimized when it equals 0, which occurs when $x=0$.  So, the minimum point of the graph of $y=|x| - 3$ is $(0,-3)$.  When we translate this to the left two units and three units down, we get the point $\\boxed{(-2,-6)}$. The answer is (-2,-6).",
  "The arithmetic sequence 1, 3, 5, $\\dots$, 17, has common difference 2, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is $1 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 1$.  If $2n - 1 = 17$, then $n = 9$, so this arithmetic sequence contains 9 terms.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(1 + 17)/2 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{81}$. The answer is 81.",
  "We have $3 \\text{ ft} = 1 \\text{ yd}$. Cubing both sides, we get $27 \\text{ ft}^3 = 1 \\text{ yd}^3$. So there are $\\boxed{27}$ cubic feet in one cubic yard. The answer is 27.",
  "Since the graph of $f$ contains the point $(-3,a)$, we know that  \\[a=f(-3)=3(-3)+b=b-9.\\]Since the graph of $f^{-1}$ also contains this point we know that $f^{-1}(-3)=a$ or $-3=f(a)$.  Therefore \\[-3=f(a)=3a+b.\\]Substitution for $a$ gives \\[-3=3(b-9)+b=4b-27.\\]Therefore $b=\\frac14(27-3)=6$. This forces \\[a=b-9=6-9=\\boxed{-3}.\\]One could also recall that the graph of $f$ is a line and the graph of $f^{-1}$ is that line reflected through $y=x$.  Since the slopes of these lines are not 1, the lines both intersect $y=x$ at a single point and that point is also the point of intersection of the graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$.  Therefore the intersection point must be $(-3,-3)$, giving $a=\\boxed{-3}$. The answer is -3.",
  "After dividing both sides by 2 and moving the constant over, we get a quadratic expression and solve for the roots: \\begin{align*}\nx^2+4x+3&\\le0\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n(x+1)(x+3)&\\le0.\n\\end{align*}The quadratic expression equals 0 at $x=-3$ and $x=-1$, meaning it changes sign at each root. Now we look at the sign of the quadratic when $x<-3$, when $-3<x<-1$, and when $x>-1$. When $x<-3$, $(x+3)$ and $(x+1)$ are both negative, so the product is positive. When $-3<x<-1$, $(x+3)$ becomes positive, while $(x+1)$ remains negative - the product is negative. When $x>-1$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive. So, $(x+1)(x+3)\\le0$ when $-3\\le x\\le-1$, which means our answer in interval notation is $\\boxed{[-3, -1]}$.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, so the graph of $(x+1)(x+3)=0$ opens up. When there are two distinct roots, the shape of the parabola means that the product is negative when $x$ is between the roots and positive when $x$ is less than both roots or greater than both roots. The answer is [-3, -1].",
  "Rearranging the expression, we have  \\[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \\[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \\Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$. The answer is 5.",
  "Since $r$ and $s$ vary inversely, $r\\cdot s$ must be a constant.  Thus $1200\\cdot .35 = s \\cdot 2400 \\Rightarrow s = \\frac{.35}2 = \\boxed{.175}$. The answer is .175.",
  "Substituting in for $d$ in terms of $c$ in the second equation gives $b = 3 (2c - 1) = 6c - 3$.\nSubstituting in for $b$ in terms of $c$ in the third equation gives $a = 3 (6c - 3) + c = 19c - 9$.\nFinally, substituting in for $a$, $b$, and $d$ in terms of $c$ in the first equation gives $2(19c-9)+3(6c-3)+5c+7(c-1) = 34$. Simplifying this gives $68c = 68$, so $c = 1$. Note that $c -1 = d$, so $d = 0$. Therefore, the product $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\boxed{0}$. The answer is 0.",
