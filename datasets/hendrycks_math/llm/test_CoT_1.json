  "For simplicity, replace the triangle with the letter $a$, the square with the letter $b$, the diamond with the letter $c$, and the club with the letter $d$. The three given equations become \\begin{align*}\na+b&=d\\\\\n2a&=5c\\\\\n2a&=c+d\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $b$. We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to eliminate $a$, to get $5c=c+d \\Rightarrow 4c=d$.
