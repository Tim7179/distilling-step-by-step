  "Since the mean of the heights of the 5 tallest buildings in Los Angeles before the new building was built was 733, the sum of their heights must have been $5\\cdot733 = 3665$. After the new building is built, the shortest of these, which was 625 feet tall, is replaced as a member of the five tallest buildings, which, since it is 885 feet tall, is $885-625 = 260$ feet taller. Therefore the sum of the heights of the five tallest buildings increases by 260 feet, to $3665 + 260 = 3925$ feet. This means that the new mean height of the 5 tallest buildings is $\\frac{3925}{5}=785$ feet, so the mean has increased by $785-733=\\boxed{52}$ feet. Note that this amount is just the difference in the height of the two buildings divided by 5. The answer is 52.",

  "A $3$-digit palindrome must be of the form $aba$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits, and $a\\neq 0$. In order for $aba$ to be divisible by $3$, we require that $a + b + a = 2a + b$ be divisible by $3$. Since $0 < a\\leq 9$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 9$, the maximum possible value of $2a+b$ is $2\\cdot 9 + 9 = 27$.  We will list all of the multiples of $3$ from $0$ through $27$, and determine how many possibilities for $a, b$ make $2a + b$ equal to that multiple.\n\nIf $2a + b = 0$, then there are no solutions such that $a \\neq 0$.\nIf $2a+b=3$, then $b=3-2a$, so $a=1$ is the only solution.\nIf $2a+b=6$, then $b=6-2a$, so $a=1,2,3$, since $a\\ge 4$ will make $b$ negative.\nIf $2a+b=9$, then $b=9-2a$, so $a=1,2,3,4$, since $a\\ge 5$ will make $b$ negative.\nIf $2a+b=12$, then $b=12-2a$, so $a=2,3,4,5,6$, since $a\\le 1$ will make $b\\ge 10$, and $a\\ge 7$ will make $b$ negative.\nIf $2a+b=15$, then $b=15-2a$, so $a=3,4,5,6,7$, since $a\\le 2$ will make $b\\ge 10$, and $a\\ge 8$ will make $b$ negative.\nIf $2a+b=18$, then $b=18-2a$, so $a=5,6,7,8,9$, since $a\\le 4$ will make $b\\ge 10$, and $a$ must be less than $10$.\nIf $2a+b=21$, then $b=21-2a$, so $a=6,7,8,9$, since $a\\le 5$ will make $b\\ge 10$, and $a$ must be less than $10$.\nIf $2a+b=24$, then $b=24-2a$, so $a=8,9$, since $a\\le 7$ will make $b\\ge 10$, and $a$ must be less than $10$.\nIf $2a+b=27$, then $b=27-2a$, so $a=9$, since as we've seen $a$ and $b$ must both be as large as possible.\n\nIn each case, a value of $a$ uniquely determines a value of $b$, so we haven't missed any palindromes.

However, 2 of these 8 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals.  So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals.  This gives a preliminary count of $9 \\times 6 = 54$ interior diagonals.

  "We know that 1/16 of a pound of cookie dough can make one cookie and we know that Annie has 3/2 pounds of cookie dough. To find the number of cookies that she can make, we have to find how many 1/16s there are in 3/2. This is the same as asking \"what is 3/2 divided by 1/16?\" so we want to find $$\\frac{3}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{16}.$$We remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal and the reciprocal of $\\frac{1}{16}$ is $\\frac{16}{1}$. Therefore, we have that $$\\frac{3}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{16}{1} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 16}{2} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24.$$Annie can make $\\boxed{24}$ cookies.

  "Since the ratio of the angle measures is $3:2:1$, the angles have measures $3x$, $2x$, and $x$ for some value of $x$.  The angle measures of a triangle sum to $180^\\circ$, so we have $3x+2x+x = 180^\\circ$.  Simplifying gives $6x=180^\\circ$, so $x=30^\\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $90^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $30^\\circ$, which means the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$ meters.

  "We consider a hand at the 12 to be $0^\\circ$. Now we convert the hour and minute hands to a degree measure from $0^\\circ$ to $360^\\circ$. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 60 minutes, we get that each minute, the minute hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=6^\\circ$. So if the minute hand is at 48 minutes, it is at $48\\cdot6^\\circ=288^\\circ$.\n\nThe hour hand is a little trickier. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 12 hours, we get that each hour, the hour hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12}=30^\\circ$. Note that the hour hand is not at the 2 since it gradually moves toward the 3 throughout the hour. From the 2 toward the 3, the hour hand has moved $\\frac{48}{60}=\\frac{4}{5}$ of the way. So the degree measure of the hour hand is $2\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot30^\\circ=84^\\circ$.\n\nTo find the smaller angle formed by the two hands, we can find the larger angle $288^\\circ-84^\\circ=204^\\circ$ and subtract from $360^\\circ$ to get $\\boxed{156^\\circ}$. Or we know that $84^\\circ$ is coterminal with (ends at the same place as) $84^\\circ+360^\\circ=444^\\circ$.

Since my brother will be twice as old as I am at that time, we must have \\[4y+6 = 2(y+6).\\]Expanding the right side gives $4y + 6 = 2y + 12$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $2y + 6 = 12$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2y = 6$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 3$.
